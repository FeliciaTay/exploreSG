You’ll want to order the Singapore-style Laksa, Leung’s tribute to our little red dot. The slippery noodles are dipped in a rich gravy made from a generous amount of prawn shells and coconut milk, with tea-smoked quail eggs and tempura tiger prawns that elevate this humble dish. The Whole Boston Lobster in Thai Dressing is another dish that shows off a creative sauce — this time, made from fish sauce, lime and chilli, and diced mangosteens and tomatoes. For lighter, more refreshing fare, try the Sashimi of Hamachi. The fleshy slices are plumped up with a zesty calamansi gel, ponzu sauce, and a smattering of slightly bitter and crunchy garlic chips.

In the day, it is a breakfast and tea lounge, serving up eggs, Viennoiseries, coffee, and high-tea platters. At lunchtime, treat yourself to tapas with a French-Asian profile, think spicy Scallop Brochette, ikura-studded Salmon Crostini, and smoky Kurobuta Pork Yakitori served up with cold soba noodles. By the night-time, all the good vibes come together to turn the space into a sexy wine and cocktail bar, serving hotel guests alongside the city’s swanky barflies, turning out barrel-aged cocktails and premium wines faster than you can say “martini”.

At 2D1N, the focus is on authentic, homely Korean cuisine. The Ginseng Chicken Soup, for instance, is a comforting dish featuring a plump, tender chicken simmered in a nourishing broth infused with slices of spiced ginger and spring onions. 

Meat lovers will also love the Korean steamed spicy chicken. A healthier alternative to the deep-fried version, the meat here is tossed with the same sweet spicy sauce, and steamed until tender. Potatoes, carrots, and onions are accompaniments that turn this dish into a hearty stew. 

Of course, the Kimchi Pancake is another not-to-be-missed classic. The crisp edges of the fried pancakes are perfect to nibble on, while the tangy slivers of kimchi nestled in the fluffy pancake help to cut through the richness of the dish. Wash it all down with a glass or two of sweet Makgeolli. (Oct 2019)

Come here for their impressive variety, with fish, prawns, lobsters, scallops and more cooked in almost every style you can dream of. You'll have a hard time deciding whether your live-caught Garoupa should be steamed in soy sauce or coated in sweet and sour sauce. The poultry and beancurd dishes are equally strong contenders, with firm favourites being the Pan-Fried Kurobuta Pork Chop with Honey Sauce and Braised Homemade Beancurd. Even humble dishes like porridge are jazzed up with the addition of a succulent lobster.

Another reason that makes this place a gem is its ambience. Tucked away in Mandai estate, its offbeat location and pared back interiors bring back memories of the good ol' kampong days.

Coupled with an extensive range of wine, whisky, sake, beers and cocktails, this humble restaurant and bar along Neil Road aims to delight and tease your discerning palates with good food and great wines. Start off small with the restaurant’s luxe offerings of modern contemporary tapas. Farmed in QianDao lake, the Caviar Oscietra is one of the world’s most expensive delicacies served here with Bilinis, Creme Fraiche and condiments for maximum flavour. Seafood lovers can opt to kickstart their meal with a serving of French Fines De Claire Oyster or Live Maine Lobster for a taste of the freshest catch from the ocean before diving into more ocean delights such as the Sea Urchin, Hokkaido Scallop or Chilean Sea Bass. For those in search of meaty options to satisfy their carnivorous cravings, we recommend ordering the 89 degrees Braised Wagyu Brisket to indulge in bone marrow, parmesan potato espuma and jamon tuile. Other equally tantalising meat dishes include the Iberico Pork “Presa” and Steak Tartare.

There is a snack menu with nibbles such as the Signature Truffle Fries, which are deep fried till golden brown and crisp, then drizzled with truffle oil and topped with parmesan cheese for an extra touch of richness. For something a little heartier, opt for the Spam Fries - deep fried luncheon meat topped with parmesan cheese and garlic mayo dip.

The Lychee Smoked Duck Pizza is another must-try. This unique dish incorporates the fruity sweetness of lychee into a meaty pizza dish. The combination may look odd on paper, but the sweet and smoky flavours combine to make a delicious dish. Not as adventurous? The Mac & Cheese is another option. Made with soft elbow pasta topped with bacon and baked with cheese, this dish is rich and sure to fuel you through a marathon singing session.

Not at Eight Korean BBQ, a sleek, industrial-chic barbecue joint at swanky Shaw Centre that prides itself on its meat know-how. Here, the focus is on exquisite cuts from premium varieties of beef and pork. They’ve sourced super-rare Mangalitza pork that has a rich meatiness and beautiful, flavourful fat, as well as Toriyama Wagyu beef, the “rolls royce” of high-end Japanese beef known for its buttery texture and flavour.
In true Korean style, you can have your meats seared unadorned, coated in a punchy marinade, or served up in a nourishing stew. The restaurant’s name is drawn from its signature dish, the Eight Colours Set, which brings eight portions of pork belly, each a different colour, from pink and unseasoned to a spicy, fiery red that signals its heavy gochujang flavour. Premium choices abound, a kind of choose-your-own-adventure Korean BBQ experience. Stop by for funky Korean BBQ and experience some of the best meat the world has to offer! (Aug 2018)

None other than E!GHT Korean BBQ, located at The Central at Clarke Quay. The exclamation mark in lieu for the letter ‘i’ is warranted at E!GHT Korean BBQ, as any food lover would get understandably hyped up over its tantalising array of impeccable BBQ meats. 

Pork features front and centre here, and we encourage guests to go whole hog. Grab a few friends and partake in the signature 8 Colours Set, where thick strips of pork belly are marinated eight different ways, with wine, ginseng, garlic, miso, and red pepper paste. If you were wondering why the pork here is so rich and tender, it’s because the establishment only uses the famous Mangalitsa pork from Hungary, better known as the ‘Kobe beef of pork’. Searching for something comforting? Then why not order up one of E!GHT’s many stews? Top picks include Beef Kimchi Stew, Seafood Bean Paste Stew, and the Army Stew. Finally, complete your meal with some grog, whether it be Korean Hite Beer or Korean Raspberry Wine.

Served with fall-off-the-bone tender mutton and a delicate Nihari sauce, the savoury and saucy bone marrow is sure to send you to umami heaven. For vegetarians, try their Palak Paneer, a thick creamy gravy with spinach and cottage cheese that will melt on your tongue and is the perfect accompaniment to any rice dish or bread.

Lovely décor wouldn’t mean very much without great grub, though, and we’re happy to say that Acqua e Farina’s mouthwatering list of Italian treats, made from produce mostly imported from Italy, is an absolute delight.
Luxuriate in Italian culinary heaven with dishes like the signature Pizza Acqua e Farina, with its delectable toppings of salami, tomato, mozzarella, ricotta cheese, and sautéed spinach. Each bite will unleash a delicious medley of flavours, and before you know it you’ll be chowing down with unexpected enthusiasm and speed! The pastas aren’t to be sneezed at either – the Spaghetti ai Gamberi is bound to impress with its helpings of oh-so-fresh prawns and a spiciness that gives it extra ‘kick’. Finally, few meals are complete without a dessert to round things off – and if you’re unsure of what to get, why not try the Piatto di Dolci? This platter contains mini portions of Crème Brûlée, Lava Cake, Panna Cotta, and Tiramisu, providing you with a very well-rounded coda to your meal. There are many other dishes on the restaurant’s hefty menu that aren’t mentioned here, so why not nip down and check it out sometime soon? You won’t regret it, we promise!

Synonymous with its Italian name, 'the Village', this unpretentious Italian Trattoria situated along Bukit Timah is known by its fans for its warm service and rustic Italian fare.
Despite its modest interior of dark wood floors and tiled bricks, the food at Al Borgo @ Alocassia Apartments is second to none. It should come as no surprise though, judging by Chef Mimmo's insistence on using only the freshest ingredients and making most of the dishes from scratch!
Diners are in for a real treat as Chef Mimmo brings his Italian roots to the plate with a range of classic Napoleon dishes such as Parma, Quattro Formaggi and Bufala Pizza - a thin crusted tomato based pizza baked to perfection and topped with arugula, slices of fresh bufala mozzarella and cherry tomatoes.
Fancy some light evening breeze while sipping on a glass of Bordeaux? Al Borgo @ Alocassia Apartments' al fresco dining area is a hit with its regulars, and it's easy to see why. Imagine enjoying some great Italian food with a glass of wine in hand, while the sun sets in the background. I guess that's what the Italians mean by 'La Dolce Vita'.

With all the Italian options in Singapore, it's no wonder the competition is stiff enough to see many a restaurant come and go, but Al Forno has stood the test of time and tastiness with a beautifully simple philosophy. Take the freshest Italian ingredients, make dishes that people know and love, and the diners will come. And while it's now a common claim to source ingredients like vine ripened whole tomatoes and peppery parmigiana directly from Italy, Al Forno was the first to do so, with exclusive imports since 1995. That means the dishes here have been tasted, tweaked and perfected so that you can't go wrong with anything on the diligently genuine, yet approachable menu.
The Linguine All' Aragosta, more commonly known as Lobster Linguine, is a house favourite, featuring salty capers and olives punctuating a naturally sweet red sauce made from cherry tomatoes. Succulent chunks of lobster tail and thick noodles of linguine soak up the sauce perfectly. For more of that divine signature sauce, go for the Spaghetti Cartoccio, which is studded with a mix of shelled seafood and baked up in a decadent foil package for two. From the pizzas, the Pizza Con Carne is a knockout, with all forms of meaty deliciousness arranged neatly atop the authentic foldable crust. The Pizza Rollo is a great starter or family pick, featuring a melt of ricotta, spinach and ham all rolled up. Looking quite charming atop their trademark checkered tablecloths, all the dishes taste as good as they look! (Mar 2015)</p></li><li><h5>THE BUZZ</h5><p>

From the invitingly open arched doors to the signature blues and whites of the Mediterranean coating the interiors, everything, including the food, will transport you to Greece.

For full authenticity, the produce is brought here, fresh from the Aegean Sea, and items on the menu are crafted by hand, which might explain the depth of flavour in dips like Taramosalata (fish-roe cream) and Melitzanosalata (smoked eggplants with walnuts). Of course, there’s more than pita and dips on the menu. Fill up on amazing Salt-Baked Fresh Fish, grilled gems like the Octopus and Squid – simply named but complex on the tongue – and mains like Kotopoulo Souvlaki (grilled chicken with fried potatoes and yoghurt) as well as Mousaka (minced beef, eggplant, potatoes and béchamel sauce). Even their drinks menu boasts Greek tipples like Mastiha and Ouzo, an uncommon sight in Singapore.

For Asian-influenced modern European cuisine in the Orchard district of Singapore, look no further than Alma by Juan Amador – the brainchild of the eponymous Spanish-German chef with three Michelin stars to his name. Helmed by executive chef Haikal Johari, whose illustrious career saw him establish the renowned Water Library restaurants in Bangkok, Thailand, Alma (which means “soul” in Spanish) takes you to the heart of dining with extraordinary, masterful creations like the signature monkfish cheek with saffron, mussel and artichoke.
You’ll find this Michelin one-star restaurant on the tranquil premises of the Goodwood Park Hotel, a heritage building on Scotts Road in Singapore’s commercial heart of Orchard. Over 300 wine labels, including several from Robert Parker’s 100-Point list, will spoil wine lovers with a penchant for European-Asian fare at Alma by Juan Amador, so don’t hesitate to approach its amiable crew if you need a recommendation.

The brunch menu is a sight to behold - featuring everything from decadent desserts to brunch staples with a twist. Artfully created thickshakes are available in a range of flavours - from peanut butter to matcha. The Matcha Maniac is particularly noteworthy for its lush green colour and generous serving of rich chantilly cream.

Bringing brunch and tea time delights infused with authentic Peranakan flavours, you’re in for a nice treat at this chill cafe. For starters, we recommend their Pulled Beef Rendang Set. Choose from either a croissant or a sourdough to complete this hearty meal, and savour the taste of the smokey, tender beef grilled to perfection. If you’re looking for a more ‘lemak’ option, Ambling Turtle’s Nonya Chicken Curry Set makes for the perfect sharing dish among friends. For those wanting just a taste of each, go for Ambling Turtle’s Croissant Sliders. Featuring Nonya Chicken Curry, Satay Chicken, and Pulled Beef Sliders, their croissant sliders are an absolute stroke of genius. Enjoy delicious meaty goodness sandwiched between a buttery flakey croissant that brings out the sweetness of the meat. For dessert, end off with Go Home, Ambling’s Pandan Buttermilk Waffle served with coconut soft serve. The best part? They’re also topped with adzuki beans and chendol jelly to make a creamy, sweet dessert that pays homage to the original flavours.

Giant platters of sausage (the Oktoberfest Platter) sit comfortably next to fragrant Spanish Paella, and the Signature Fish and Truffle Chips are mentioned in the same breath as Risotto with Pancetta & Foie Gras. If you have ever wanted to eat everything that Europe has to offer in one sitting, this is the place to be.
In the words of its founder, Stanley Ng, Ambush offers a “whistle-stop tour of all the best that European food has to offer...Start in France, continue through Spain, then relax with a moreish dessert and coffee in Italy – and be home in time to plan your next gastronomic adventure!”
Short of teleporting from one European city to another, Ambush is really your best bet for an eating tour of Europe in a single meal.

Offering a full menu of Japanese tapas, sashimi, rice and soba bowls, as well as bar snacks, it’s a great place for lunch, dinner, and post-work drinks with colleagues. 

While it’s a casual place, they’re serious about their food. The main highlights are their kushiyaki selections, with grilled skewers that include Shiitake Truffle Yaki and Ebi Mentaiko Yaki for those who want to up their ante. Mains include the Unagi Kebayaki and Garlic Fried Rice, the latter a staple of any good teppanyaki joint. And yes, their teppanyaki selection heats things up with Surumeika Teppanyaki, with squid and butter soyu. 

Even if you’re just here for drinks, you’ll be tempted by their selection of bar snacks on offer. Have the best of everything with the Ameising Platter, consisting of Amaebi, Tako, Popcorn Chicken, Kawa Karaage, and Curry Samosa. For something lighter, opt for the Sashimi Platter instead.

Lunch includes wallet-friendly options such as the set lunch of grilled selections or sashimi, which comes with salad, miso soup, rice, and pickles. If you prefer a fuss-free alternative, their rice, noodle, and grain bowls pack a punch — we recommend their Poke Bowl Soba, Quinoa Bowl, and Ribeye Soba. 

Their fully stocked sake collection even has a helpful sake meter value to help you narrow your choices from sweet to dry.

On Her Majesty’s Secret Service is a playful tribute to designer Anouska Hempel — a former Bond Girl from the 1969 namesake film — in the form of a dry gin martini tipped with yuzu and green tea bitters.

The Hong Long Choc is a seductive swirl of whisky, chocolate liqueur, aromatic bitters and Lapsang Souchong — perfect for chocolate lovers to satisfy their cocoa cravings.

And no details have been spared here, from the decor that features a sushi counter fashioned from a 180-year-old block of hinoki cypress wood to the imported ingredients flown in from Japan. 

Heading this restaurant is none other than Taku Ashino, whose precision and meticulousness help elevate the delicate ingredients them spectacular. Having trained in various sushi restaurants in Tokyo for over a decade, Ashino pays careful attention to making the ingredients sing, grilling his fish over a binchotan grill instead of a gas torch, as well as cooking a blend of Hokkaido and Niigata rice in a traditional iron rice pot with Mount Fuji water to achieve the perfect texture of rice. 

Whether you choose a set or omakase menu for lunch, rest assured that you’ll be in good hands.

Located in The Centrepoint, Awadh is the perfect destination for gastronomes from all walks of life, serving a wide array of meat, seafood and vegetarian dishes. Be sure to try the Paya. These trotters are seasoned with a diverse mix of spices and left to cook overnight over a slow fire, creating a flavourful and tender bite. Awadh also has vegan options such as the “Impossible” kebabs or curries. Committed to showcasing the culinary heights of Northern India, the menu at Awadh changes with each season, and is unique to the festivals that mark the month.

With a hip culture tailor-made for Tras Street, BAM! hits all the high notes.
Merging two cuisines is hardly groundbreaking, however BAM!'s inspired blending of Spanish tapas with small plates that are meant to be shared, and a Japanese sake-flowing izakaya, is spot on. The category is a bit hazy - is it a tapakaya? sakapas? - but whatever you choose to call it, the dining experience here is nothing short of uproarious.
The digs are adequately cool kid-chic, with the requisite hipster trimmings of concrete and not much else. Nude bulbs and the underbelly of the dining room's wiring are starkly exposed. Despite the naked decor, BAM! is not blushing at all with a boldly confident gastronomic vision and spot-on flavours. The vibe draws on the hearty camaraderie of Spanish bars with the real world grit of izakayas, for a pitch-perfect air of laidback dining.
The menu reads like a daily market billboard, hailing the freshest and peak-season ingredients. There are some mainstays though that have earned their permanent placement. The Pasta a la Plancha with Prawn and Sake Butter is next-level umami, with just enough acidity from the wine. And sake doesn't just make a one-time appearance, with a glassed-in cooler of both popular and hard-to-find brands. The resident sake sensei will not only pair your dishes with ample pours, but will show you how to really make the most of it, encouraging you to drizzle the wine into the luscious Kampong Egg with crispy squid and punchy chorizo, another menu regular.
As its name suggests, BAM! is loud and proud of its excellent fusion angle. The hip setting, top-notch food, and unique sake spin, make it deserving of its exclamation point. (Aug 2014)</p></li><li><h5>THE BUZZ</h5><p>""Savour small plates like Calamari ""A La Plancha"", Beef Tongue and Rostit Sauce while you sip on their specialty sake cocktails (they're all good - we couldn't pick a fave!)."" -Honeycombers
""Former chef de cuisine of the now-closed Santi at Marina Bay Sands, Pepe Moncayo has just set up Bam! - a modern diner which sees an unusual mix of sake and tapas, like kampong egg with fried calamari and chorizo, and market fish tartar with burrata. Date night, we hear your call!"" - Sassy Mama Singapore
""Kampong egg with chanterelle mushroom and ham is a delicious concoction of umami, smoky-sweet yolkiness. Another must-try is the sous vide pig's ear with creamy burrata and anchovy vinaigrette."" -Expat Living
""What will draw return visits is the Mushroom Rice With Scallop And Idiazabal Cheese. Everything comes together so well - the sweet, lightly seared scallop; the full-flavoured stock the rice is cooked in; the crunchy bits of mushrooms embedded in the rice; and the stretchy, melted Spanish cheese. Every mouthful brings so much pleasure to the palate that I find myself eating it slowly, wishing the experience would not end."" -The Straits Times
""Serving food from the Mediterranean with a Japanese state of mind, Bam!'s spin on the whole sharing plates and smaller portion trend incorporates sake into the mix, led by executive chef Pepe Moncayo's belief that sake turns up the dial on the fifth taste: umami"" -Time Out Singapore</p></li><li><h5>SATURDAY BRUNCH (3 APR ONWARDS)</h5><p>When: Every Saturday from 3 April onwards

Have an appetising serving of the restaurant’s Tod Mun Pla, and savour the explosion of flavours with every bite you take –  you won’t be forgetting these fish cakes in a hurry, that’s for sure - or dip your spoon into a delightfully spicy bowl of Tom Yum Goong, which comes with helpings of sweet and juicy prawns to add on to the sour tang. If you’re a dessert person, then the Tap Tim Krob, or red rubies topped with coconut ice cream, will be a perfect, refreshing way to end your meal. You won’t regret having the crowd-pleasers either, like the heavenly Khao Neaw Ma Muang (mango sticky rice), with its pleasantly chewy and fragrant rice.
Although it’s perfectly understandable if all your attention is focused on trying not to stuff your face with the goodies on offer at Bangkok Jam, or if you’re actually doing the deed and completely disregarding your surroundings (we get it), do take some time to soak in the ambience.

With mouth-watering items incorporating everything from beloved local flavours to japanese-inspired fillings, you're sure to fall back in love with the humble bao.

It's an umami bomb that will leave you craving more.
Baos aren't all they have to offer though.

Chef Stephane Istel was determined to open his own restaurant by the time he was thirty-five years old, and the food on offer at the modern rotisserie and bar provides an intimate insight into the experiences that have made the man.
The heart of the menu, of course, is made up of the meats from the rotisserie. Both the French Free Range Chicken and Australian Pork knuckle have won rave reviews, and we could definitely understand why. But don't fixate on just those items though, because while the rotisserie may be the heart, Chef Stephane's deft touch and heartfelt recipes are the soul of what's on offer. Whether it be the tarte flambee, signature to his home town of Alsace, or his mother's apple pie recipe, there's a delicate balance of tradition and modernity in the food and the decor that makes the entire experience undeniably unique.
And when you finally look up from your empty plate, sated and satisfied, contemplate the open kitchen and the stoic, rustic materials of stone, wood, and cement. There's a soft harmony to the design that maintains an elegant poise, a perfect mirror to the generous food served by Chef Stephane paired with the impeccable service directed by manager Kori Millar. It's a restaurant born of dreams, love, and togetherness, and their motto, ""Love on the Plate"" couldn't be any more apt. (Jul 2013)</p></li><li><h5>THE BUZZ</h5><p>
""There is nothing fancy, just everyday French fare, but it is food like this that one does not tire of. I went for dinner twice in a week and enjoyed the second visit as much as the first one, even with repeat dishes. Dishes such as the tarte flambee, which looks like a thin, rectangular pizza but with quite different toppings, win my heart at the first bite."" -The Straits Times
""The menu is French-influenced but not strictly so. A Spanish-leaning octopus salad makes a showing on the lunch menu, a Moroccan-accented lamb shank with couscous at dinner. But the real stunners are the chicken, lamb and beef dishes crafted around the Rotisol, an electric-powered rotisserie oven that can hold up to 60kg of meats."" -The Business Times
""When you eat here, you feel like you’re part of a family dinner, with Chef Stephane jovially bringing sharing feast platters to the table himself. The ""made with love"" feel of the  mostly Alsatian dishes is evident from the care Stephane takes with his ingredients and preparation – all meat is brined first for moist succulence."" -Expat Living
""The eclectic but tasteful mixture of styles, chosen by co-owner Kori Miller (former GM of Sky on 57), is likewise reflected in its French-inspired menu by her partner, chef Stephane Istel (formerly of db Bistro Moderne), which combines traditional cooking methods with the innovative use of ingredients.""- Time Out Singapore</p></li><li><h5>DISHES WE LOVE</h5><p>Signature Seafood Platter, Char-Grilled Octopus served with Arugula, Tomato Confit, Almonds, and Romesco Coulis, Free Range Chicken, ""Mom's Recipe"" Apple Pie</p></li><li><h5>SUNDAY BRUNCH MENU</h5><p>Check out our new Sunday Brunch!

The food here leans towards the fiery side of Thai cuisine, so come prepared to take the heat. Start your meal with some appetisers to share, such as Satay Gai (chicken with peanut sauce) skewers, or some Tod Mun Goong -- fried prawn patties with a side of sweet and sour plum sauce for dipping. 

Love curries? The ones at Basil & Thyme don’t shy away from the heat. Tuck into Kaeng Daeng, a creamy and spicy combination packed with your choice of chicken, beef, or seafood. For milder versions, try the Kaeng Khiew Hwan Gai, a lighter green curry that is more gentle on your tastebuds. Be sure to also order a side of roti (flat bread) to sop up all the spicy, creamy gravy. 

The classic Pad Thai ranks high on the must-try list. Here, the stir-fried noodle dish is redolent with a smoky char, tossed with a generous helping of plump prawns, fresh seafood, or chicken. An interesting rice dish to try is the Khao Tom Pla, a watery congee made from soft-boiled rice with slices of tender fish. 

Be sure to save some space for dessert as well. The crowd-favourite Khao Niao Mamuang is one of the best versions of mango sticky rice in town, drizzled with a fragrant and rich house-made coconut cream. (Jun 2019)

New home opens a fresh chapter for the Michelin one-star restaurant by Chef-Patron Aitor Jeronimo Orive 

April 2021, Singapore - Where ships entering the harbour of Singapore came for fresh water, now gastronomes flock to for a fresh new dining experience. Introducing Basque Kitchen — back after a brief hiatus — in its new home at the historic Fullerton Waterboat House.  

The second home marks the beginning of a new chapter for Basque Kitchen. Established in October 2018 as Singapore’s first Basque-centric restaurant celebrating the country’s indigenous culture and produce, Basque Kitchen was awarded its first Michelin Star in the 2019 edition of Michelin Guide Singapore.  

In the new location, Chef-Patron Aitor Jeronimo Orive — alumni of the Michelin-starred kitchens of The Fat Duck in London, Mugaritz in San Sebastián and Neura in Bilbao — and his team continue to stay true to the produce-driven culinary philosophy that their customers love, executed with even greater finesse while remaining approachable. The Basque gastronomic experience is also more immersive, with a pintxos bar and lounge welcoming diners to unwind over a flute of cuvee champagne created especially for the restaurant, and to tease the tastebuds with the diverse range of light bites. In the semi-open kitchen, a duo of handsome Josper grills, custom-designed for the restaurant, anchor the space, offering diners a glimpse of the deliciousness to come. Within the 38-seat main dining hall of the new Basque Kitchen, a private dining room that seats eight makes a perfect venue for small, discreet gatherings.  

Basque Kitchen will also host the exclusive members-only space for American Express Centurion and Platinum Card Members, called Platinum at Basque Kitchen. Comprising 18 seats at the dining hall and 18 seats at the pintxos bar, the dedicated space boasts the finest views of the Fullerton waterfront. Centurion and Platinum Card Members will also enjoy priority reservations, and a suite of complimentary experiences including valet service and welcome drinks.

An Immersive Experience 

Premier design agency Grey Matters, the same behind the likes of Cloudstreet, Tippling Club, and W Maldives, draws on the elements of Earth, Water, Fire, Air — also considered the four cornerstones of Basque cooking — to create a space that marries rusticism with modern sophistication. Think the juxtaposition of charcoal stained oak floorboards against plush velvet banquettes; the cool of gleaming embossed metal detailing balanced by the buttery softness of cream-hued leather; rippled glass creating a dance of light as water does; contoured lines all around, reminiscent of the coast of the Basque country, facing the Bay of Biscay. Dressed in a harmonious palette of charcoal greys, warm orange and oaky tones and given accents of gold and copper, it’s a space that is as invitingly comfortable as an old friend’s home as it is elegantly refined and fitting of special occasions.  

The pinxtos bar and lounge that seats 33 persons sets the tone for enjoyment. From the a la carte menu comes exquisite offerings such as artisanal Sanfilippo anchovies — perfected over 125 years by five generations of a Cantabrian family and exclusively available in Singapore at Basque Kitchen — served simply with tomatoes atop crisp curasao flatbread; a classic dish of goose barnacle slivers served with tender nuggets of sous vide abalone, piparras olives, piquillo peppers; and a moreish wagyu burger with amera tomato, pickled cucumber, caramelised onions and epoisses cheese. Apart from the authentic light bites served on bar plates made by Catalan tableware design studio Luesma & Vega, patrons can also indulge in oysters served four ways, or caviar by the tin before moving on to the main meal.  

In the dining room, a tasting menu is offered exclusively for lunch and dinner (from $158++ for lunch to $248++ for dinner). Crafted using painstakingly sourced Basque produce, complimented by premium seasonal ingredients from Japan — such as deep sea fish, uni and scallops, the menus also showcase house-aged beef. In the aging fridge — two to three times bigger than before — prime cuts such as Australian and Japanese wagyu are meticulously dry-aged for a minimum of 45 days. Following the style in the Basque country, the team also sources for beef from mature livestock about eight years of age — that which presents intensely deep and complex flavours and textures. 

Charcoal-grilled items anchor the tasting menus: such as Charcoal grilled blackspot bream and razor clam dressed in a typically Basque Donostiarra sauce made from the classic San Sebastián style pil pil; and a charcoal grilled old beef loin, its rich flavours amplified by a smoked garlic mousseline and a drizzle of truffle jus. Accompanying these are inspired items such as a jelly of tomato essence served with a tomato sorbet and Japanese fruit and micro tomatoes, and a sea anemone served with bomba rice and sea succulents, finished with a fragrant chive aioli — further demonstrating the breadth and depth of Chef Aitor’s evolved and elevated repertoire.  

Complementing the food is an expanded beverage list personally selected by General Manager Vincent Jaureguiberry. The industry veteran who has passed through the doors of Pierre Gagnaire in France and Saint Pierre Restaurant in Singapore looks beyond prized vintages and awards to find the true merit in good wines. He sees wines as expressions of the people behind each bottle, and takes the effort to meet the winemakers. As such, Basque Kitchen’s list of over 600 wines is a unique collection comprising of fine and rare wines from both prestigious houses and small producers. Each bottle also represents a moment in Vincent’s wine journey — and that of the restaurant’s wine service team.  

Some highlights from the collection include a vintage juice made from an apple variety native to the Basque country, commissioned by the restaurant, a terroir-driven French Basque natural cider from Domaine Bordatto, exclusive to Basque Kitchen; and an exclusive vintage collection from Basque winery Artadi. Of note is also the Jean Louis Vergnon Champagne “Conversation”, a blanc de blanc produced especially for Basque Kitchen in the renowned Cote des Blanc, homeland of the oldest and most mineral Chardonnay. Patrons can also look forward to weekly vineyard highlights, with wines offered by the glass, to be introduced at a later stage.  

On the list is also an extensive range of sherries, from crisp Finos to nectar-like Pedro Ximenez. Connoisseurs will take delight in exquisite drops such as those from celebrated Andalusian sherry maker Bodegas Pérez Barquero. The Solera Fundacional 1905 and Solera Cincuentenario 1955 from the 116 year-old bodega are considered guardians of a classical, extraordinary style, and at Basque Kitchen sherry enthusiasts will have the opportunity to sample the Amontillado 1955 and Oloroso 1955 from the Solera Cincuentenario series of the house, amongst other noble selections. 

“Basque Kitchen by Aitor is a celebration of Basque heritage, but it is also a celebration of the hearts and minds of our team,” shares Chef Aitor. “Every dish is a loving tribute to my own grandmothers; and every bottle marks a personal moment in the wine journey of our sommeliers. We hope not just to intrigue you with an immersive gastronomic experience, but also touch your heart with every drop and morsel presented.” (Apr 2021)</p></li><li><h5>DISHES WE LOVE</h5><p>Chorizo Brioche Bun, Chocolate, Vegetable Bomba Rice, Golden Snapper</p></li><li><h5>ABOUT BASQUE KITCHEN: A CELEBRATION OF HERITAGE AND PASSION</h5><p>Basque Kitchen by Aitor is a fine dining restaurant that showcases contemporary Basque cuisine reinterpreted by Chef-Patron Aitor Jeronimo Orive. Housed within the historical building of The Fullerton Waterboat House, it comprises a pinxto bar and lounge, a dining room and a private room, boasting fine views across the waterfront. Basque Kitchen by Aitor is open for both lunch and dinner, offering an exclusive tasting menu for each of the sessions.</p></li><li><h5>ABOUT CHEF-PATRON AITOR JERONIMO ORIVE: A SON OF BASQUE COUNTRY</h5><p>A proud descendant of Basque Country, Aitor’s love for cooking was cultivated at a young age. One who grew up on rustic homecooked fare lovingly prepared by his grandparents — his paternal family hailing from the Basque region of Andaluci´a, and his mother’s family from the Southern Basque region of Biscay — Aitor naturally took to cooking as an expression of his heritage. He further honed his skills as a culinary professional at some of the most iconic restaurants of the world, including Basque Country’s own Mugaritz, Neura in Bilbao, and The Fat Duck in London.  

Combining past and present culinary influences on a plate, he presents a repertoire of dishes that celebrates classic Basque flavours and produce, and pays homage to his two grandmothers — the greatest inspirations in his life. Yet his cuisine is current and accessible to a global audience. Through the application of contemporary cooking techniques and novel ingredient pairings inspired through his travels and experiences around the world, he injects a modern, cosmopolitan dimension into his renditions of Basque cuisine.  

In October 2018, Aitor — having travelled from Europe to Australia and finally to Singapore — collaborated with Unlisted Collection for his first solo endeavour. Basque Kitchen by Aitor, Singapore’s first Basque-centric restaurant, was unveiled as a celebration of the Basque Country’s rich bounties and culinary heritage. 

Passionate about developing young talent, Aitor also sees the restaurant as a platform for nurturing the future leaders in the F&B industry. Working alongside him are local talent such as Chef de Cuisine Azrin Rahman — one half of the team that did Singapore proud at the 2019 International Catering Cup by clinching the Silver Trophy; and Junior Sous Chef Leong Tan, both of whom have worked with him since the opening of Basque Kitchen by Aitor in 2018.</p></li><li><h5>MICHELIN GUIDE SINGAPORE 2021</h5><p>Basque Kitchen by Aitor has been awarded 1 Michelin Star.</p></li><li><h5>href</h5><p>https://www.chope.co/singapore-restaurants/restaurant/basque-kitchen-by-aitor</p></li>","Basque Kitchen by Aitor","https://www.chope.co/singapore-restaurants/restaurant/basque-kitchen-by-aitor",1

Don’t be surprised to spot a fair number of coffee aficionados at this joint. Under the helm of Bearded Bella’s, a former Singapore National Barista Championship winner, baristas are taught how to craft each cup of joe with great precision and care. Then pair your coffee with a Spiced Scramble. A clever take on scrambled eggs, this cafe gussies this dish up with turmeric and truffle, alongside the medley of mushrooms, kale, and dehydrated tomatoes. And there isn’t any foul play to be had with the cheekily-named Fowl Play, which combines crumbled chicken thigh, charred miso corn, roasted cauliflower, and sage into one delightful dish. Looking for something sweet? Then check out the sweet and citrusy Donut Sliders, composed of yuzu and chocolate ice cream, crushed Tim Tam’s, raspberry, and basil coulis.
 
A perfect blend of great bites, pleasing ambience, and Aussie-style coffees, Bearded Bella is making a name for itself with its unique flair and style. (Jun 2018)

If you’ve ever chowed down on the deluxe pizzas at Bella Pizza, you know you’re in for a treat. Here, there’s a full Italian menu including pastas and charcoal grilled meats, turned out by a highly-trained team of chefs drawn from top Italian restaurants all over the island. Dine alfresco to really soak up the Robertson Quay vibes, but also because pasta tastes better with a side of people watching - and you’ll be doing a lot of people watching, because one plate won’t be enough. Think chewy batons of Cavatelli pasta tossed with wilted spinach and salty Parma Ham or a bountiful Linguine Frutti de Mare, a garlicky toss-up of linguine and tender shrimp, clams, and squid. One of the highlights is a beautiful, generous portion of Pappardelle Boscoiala, ribbony strips of pasta in a rich, tomato-based mushroom sauce. Beyond pasta, fill up on their hefty charcoal grilled meats and seafood. A particularly attractive Grigliata Gamberi E Calamari sees smoky grilled squid and fleshy big prawn served with little other than a squeeze of lemon and their own juices with fresh arugula.

Grab a seat in the alfresco area and you could almost be on a Roman street, soaking up the sights, sounds, and, most importantly, smells. Here, the pizza is made fresh by hand in the Neapolitan style, meaning the crust has the perfect balance between chewiness and crispiness. That sweet spot is probably why the pizzas here are regularly touted amongst some of the best in town. Obviously it’s not just about the crust: imagine the sinful appeal of a pizza crowned by wobbly mounds of creamy Burrata cheese, or topped with an elegant fan of thinly sliced salmon on a bed of spinach. If all that’s too rich, reach for the bright flavours of anchovies, capers, and tomatoes in their Napoleon pizza, or the simple pleasures of Gorgonzola, browned onions, and Mozzarella in the Pizza Cipolla. There’s also pastas, like the especially indulgent Truffle-bomb, Fettuccine Salciccia Fe Tartufo, where noodles are tossed in a truffle cream, topped with freshly-shaved black truffle. It’s very hard to top the joy of pizza, but here it becomes an art. (Mar 2017)</p></li><li><h5>THE BUZZ</h5><p>“Some say that Bella Pizza tops the list of best pizza places in Singapore.

Dig into one of their signature waffles. The Hojicha Molten Waffle. Made with roasted matcha and topped with Kurogoma Ice Cream, this dish is both Insta-worthy and delicious.

The Popiah Goreng, for instance, is an appetiser not to be missed. The vegetable spring rolls are made in-house, and deep-fried until crispy. Perfect for dipping into a house-made spicy chilli sauce. Another popular appetiser is the Daging Bungkus Kukus. This rare treat features a fluffy pancake, filled with juicy ground meat marinated with herbs and bathed in a housemade gravy, 

If you’re craving a bowl of hot soup, be sure to try the restaurant’s signature Sup Ekor Sapi Bijian. This savoury soup is redolent with freshly ground spices, and chock-full of tender braised oxtail. For mains, Bijan serves a selection of Western and Malay classics, with the occasional fusion dish. The Spaghetti Rendang, for instance, is the perfect dish for diners who crave a little pasta, but still want to inhale the aroma and heartiness of beef rendang. 

From the wok, expect fluffy rice infused with Malay herbs over roaring flames. The smoke-kissed Traditional Kerabu Rice Bijan is packed with flavour, and served with crackers for garnish and strips of juicy beef. Also good from the Mains selection is the Gulai Lemak Daging Salai Dengan Jantung Pisang. Made the traditional way, this hearty stew features fresh banana flower cooked in a turmeric gravy, with slices of fork-tender chargrilled Australian sirloin. 

Be sure to save some space for dessert as well. The Banana Fritters with Coconut Ice Cream is a gourmand’s dream, where golden-brown sweet pillows of fruit are topped with a creamy coconut ice cream, and drizzled with a rich gula melaka. Order this one to share. (Jul 2019)

Inspired by a yakitori-ya in Osaka, the all-in-one Japanese yakitori restaurant by Chef Asai Masashi is a true find for more than one reason! 

Head down the Moh Guan Terrace alley and around the back of the unassuming Hua Bee stand to find a metal door with small, wiry Bincho lettering. Then down the rabbit hole you go, transitioning briskly from the traditional neighbourhood feel to the likes of an underground bunker, complete with rough edges, shady lighting, and oxidized copper tones. Take a seat at the marble bar for a front row seat to all the grilling action, or the domed booths to get your drink on, like the restaurant's most notable fruit, herb and sake-centric cocktails from the resident barkeep. With both food and drink menus largely in-flux at the whim of the chef and cocktailier, it's best to go with the daily recommendations.

Food wise, get ready for a smoky experience of grilled goodness and smoky delights. With a menu inspired by the 24 micro-seasons in Japan, expect only the best produce of the season being featured on the menu. Available all year round, try the restaurant's famed protein - the tori (chicken), popular cuts like wings, breast and thighs masterfully executed over the bincho-tan charcoal. Or for a unique experience, chicken tail, cartilage, heart, gizzard, liver and cockscomb.

""It's all about omakase (chef's selection, with sets from $50-$80), with Head Chef Asai Masashi turning out a variety of small plates (chicken tsukune with egg yolk; salmon avocado yukke wrap with seaweed; lots of grilled meat and veggies) most of which are cooked over the charcoal grill."" -SG Now

All meats and vegetables are grilled over the restaurant’s signature Bincho-tan, Japanese white charcoal. 

For the best experience, order the Yakitori Platter to share. Here, you’ll find every bit of chicken — from safer parts like thigh and wing, to the lesser-ordered neck and tail — grilled to charred perfection. This second Bincho outfit also has new menu items, such as the Uni Shabu Shabu. The light, creamy broth is infused with Japanese sea urchin, forming the base for an array of succulent seafood like prawns, oysters, and abalone. Get your daily dose of greens with the Yasai Maki (vegetable rolls), where wafer-thin slices of pork and beef are wrapped around yam, corn, and mushrooms, then grilled over an open flame. Wash it all down with cups of sake, or some rare Japanese whiskies. (May 2019)

But the dishes here are far from the typical Eggs Benedict or pancake stack. Instead, the food is a delicious fusion of Western with Sichuan influences. Take the Yuxiang (fish fragrance). The sauce is traditionally made by frying doubanjiang, garlic and ginger with pickled chilli, served with meaty eggplants. At Birds of a Feather, the same dish comes with an extra layer of mozzarella cheese, and a generous sprinkle of mantou crumbs. 
If you’re a big fan of spicy food, items like the Fortune Skewers are a must-order. This crowd favourite has gotten a new twist, and now comes with a fiery Sichuan red oil. Birds of a Feather specially pick their spices from Chengdu’s spice market, and these are laboriously  fried with chillies to create this house-made oil. 

Not all Sichuan dishes are numbingly spicy, either. The Sichuan Oxtail Soup is a light, clear broth, akin to the familiar pig’s trotters soup. Chinese herbs and fresh leek infuse this comforting soup with plenty of flavour. 

Just looking for a relaxed night out, with drinks and some simple grub? The street food-inspired selection is the perfect bar snack. Definitely order the Charcoal Grilled Pork Bits.

""Eggplant cooked Greek style was definitely an exotic taste for us - the dip was slightly creamy and pleasant on the tongue.
A personal favourite was the fava yellow lentils with fresh onion, oregano and extra virgin olive oil.

Garnering rave reviews for their skillfully prepared dishes, it's pretty clear that this joint is more than just a dining destination with a stunning view. The Blue Lotus Signature Chilli Pomelo Crab - what can be considered their claim to fame - has people flocking from far and wide just for a taste. Simmered with lemongrass and curry leaves, and with just enough chilli to give it a kick - it's one creation we can't get enough of. And don't even get us started on their Wok Fried Kagoshima Wagyu Beef Tenderloin served with peppercorn. Using half-cooked well-marbled beef which is then put into a heated stone bowl to finish cooking, get ready for a piping hot bowl of deliciousness.
To end the meal opt for one of their unique dessert choices. The Lemon Gelo served with a lime sorbet, one of our favourites, is a refreshing treat. With an invigorating citrus punch and a sweet jelly base, it's one dessert you'll be craving for days to come! (Mar 2020)</p></li><li><h5>THE BUZZ</h5><p>""The Blue Lotus Signature Chilli Pomelo Crab has none of the ketchup-laden gravy thickened with egg found in many seafood restaurants. Instead, the sauce is a concoction of chopped herbs and spices such as lemongrass and curry leaves, with just enough chilli to give it fire without scorching the tongue. Meaty pieces of a whole Sri Lankan crab, usually weighing about 1.5kg, are stirred into this delicious mix until just cooked and its sweet flesh infused with its aromatic herbs and spices."" -The Straits Times

Kick off with small plates like Kampong Fried Chicken Wings, Salted Pepper Squid, Masala Spiced Fried Fish Cutlets, and Butter Chickpeas, which will give you a sense of the sure-handed East-meets-West cuisine on offer here. Mains evolve into comforting plates like DIY pasta plates where you match your favourite pasta to your favourite sauce. Dunk some Fettuccine in their delectable Meatball Pomodoro Sauce or a heady Puttanesca, or have some Pappardelle tossed up in that Roman classic: Cacio E Pepe, a humble but gut-punching mix of fresh cheese and insane amounts of black pepper. 

Their state of the art Beechwood Stone Hearth turns out perfect pizzas, and the flavours here are bolder than you might get at other pizzaries. Think a no-holds barred Anchovies pizza, strewn with melty buffalo mozzarella and sous-vide eggs, or a salty Pepperoni e Salami, the twin sausages of Italian life paired with capers and piquant tomatoes. For a more carnal approach, order off the grill, with numbers like a juicy New York Strip Steak and a tender Baby Lamb Rack Au Jus sure to sate your carnivorous streak. Craft beers, Japanese whiskies, and punchy cocktails may have to do in place of dessert, because the night is young, and what else are you going to do with that food coma? (Feb 2018)

An island retreat calls for a relaxing yet zesty beverage such as the Electric Mango, a unique combination of Mackintosh blended scotch, Pierre Ferrand dry curacao and Mathilde Peche liqueur, topped with salted mango cheeks, Crawley’s agave syrup and lemon juice. Just like with food, a little bit of salt can enhance the flavour of a cocktail.

Drop by with your loved ones and pair your favourite cut of beef with an exquisite bottle of red or white for a memorable meal here at Boeuf Singapore. 

Explore beef in a variety of culinary styles with the restaurant’s team of experienced chefs. With three different signature cuts featuring the bone, short ribs and asada ribeye, meat lovers can look forward to satisfying their carnivorous cravings with these meaty goodness served up with yummy sides such as grilled toast and celeriac puree. Start off your meal with a cured board of pastrami, bresaola wagyu and air-dried olive oil to whet your appetite. For those who like their steaks grilled to perfection, we recommend moving on to the Australian grass fed Prime Angus.

There's casual, and then there's Boiler-style casual. The kind of casual that lets you get down and dirty, in the tastiest way possible, with your meal. The Boiler features a laidback set up, allowing you to choose your fresh seafood to be boiled to order. You can go a la carte, but the Bombdiggity Bag with Dungeness crab, prawns, mussels, sausages and corns offers tons of bang for your buck. Next, choose a sauce ranging from slightly piquant to can't-feel-your-lips spicy. Your sack of goodies is prepared and then poured directly onto the paper-topped table. Formality is tossed aside along with the shells as you dig in to get to every nook and cranny of the succulent seafood, taking the phrase ""finger-licking good"" very literally. Bibs and phone covers are included.
Located near the tourist attractions like the Singapore Flyer and Merlion, The Boiler is a real find for lunch, when the usual seafood feast is fine-tuned to the mid-day meal. Tidy but still decadent dishes like Signature Fish & Chips, the Ultimate Burger with caramelized onions and Crispy Prawn Pasta Prawn Pasta Soup are great options. Any-time Sides like Salt & Pepper Crispy Chicken, the succulent fried Lobsicle on a stick, Sweet Potato Fries, and Momma's Scoop with an indulgently creamy cheesy dip are all worth the calorie splurge. After all, it's not every day that you get to go elbow deep into amazing Louisiana-style seafood. So head on down and live it up!

Executing every dish with creativity and passion, chef Thomas believes in using only premium ingredients for an authentic taste of Japan.Great for intimate dinners or casual dates, the Signature Set serves two with a variety of dishes that make up the appetisers and mains. Kickstart your meal with a bowl of Signature Pitan Tofu. An interesting take on tofu, the cold tofu was garnished with fish role, spring onion and bits of finely chopped century egg. Drenched in a fragrant mixture of sesame and century egg sauce, this dish is a delightful start to the omakase meal.Another tasty dish on the set is the Ikura Onsen. An egg-on-egg concept that is beautifully executed, the ikura complements the mellow onsen egg, leaving a mildly sweet aftertaste. The melt-in-your-mouth assorted sashimi is definitely the highlight of the set. Refresh your palate at the end of a heavy meal with a scoop of Hokkaido Ice Cream before leaving happy and satisfied.

One-of-a-kind in terms of its compact dynamism, Buko Nero prides itself on serving food that they themselves would want to eat, if they were the customer. The wife, Tracy, who is Singaporean, handles the front of the restaurant, while the husband, Oscar, an Italian, is the chef. Together, they have created something that is semi-legendary in the Singapore dining scene because of the quality of food and the waiting list for this restaurant. 

Top of the list of recommendations for this unique establishment is the Buko Nero Tau Kwa Tower with sauteed vegetables and Asian dressing, which was created as a stacked dish consisting of vegetables such as parsley, carrots, and enoki mushrooms layered atop a big piece of tau kwa (firm tofu). Kecap manis (Indonesian sweet soya sauce) is drizzled over it, giving the entire concoction an extra oomph. Deceptively simple, this dish has won fans because of its unique flavour combination and freshness of vegetables used. The Baked Fillet of Cod, which is presented with a crust made of olives and a sweet bell pepper coulis, has also won praise for its simple yet effective use of basic ingredients. For cosy Italian fare in the heart of Singapore, it is hard to find a more intimate, homely dining experience than this well-loved restaurant that serves food straight from the heart.

Its newly revamped food and libations menu promises to tantalise with fresh, novel creations that spotlight local produce as well as ingredients that are sustainably sourced.Boasting exciting flavour combinations, the revamped menu follows the prevailing format of Small Plates and Snacks, Baos, Buns, Dumplings, hearty meats and decadent desserts, designed to be shared in a communal dining style. Kick off with a series of new small plates - Nori Pie Tee, where dressed tuna tartare with chives are served in crispy seaweed pie tee shells, and garnished with marinated ikura and wasabi cream cheese mayo, presenting an elevated and creative twist on the popular Peranakan appetiser. Inject a jolt of vibrancy to your meal and opt for the Scallop Ceviche, featuring anumami-laden Vietnamese dressing of lime juice, fish sauce, red chilli and freshly chopped shallots and finished with a creamy wasabi avocado puree.When at Butcher Boy, one should never skip the meats. One of the latest creations, the Josper-grilled Lamb Rack, is served Tandoori style with a marinated red curry and boasts a flame-kissed crust, while the classic signature Pastrami Beef Short Ribs is slow-cooked at 58°C for 48 hours to achieve optimal tenderness. Ensuring that the team keeps up with the evolution of the guests’ preferences of having less meat, vegetarian options such as Grilled Padron Peppers with smoked burrata and garlic sesame crumbs have been added to the menu while the Karana Jackfruit and Mushroom Pot Stickers, made from plant-based product, Karana, has long been a crowd favourite. Another perennial mainstay on the menu, the Warm Chilli Crab with Mantou Buns is sure to delight purists with the generous serving of sweet crab meat drenched with an authentic, signature chilli crab sauce with a side of homemade mantou buns fried to perfection. Wind up the meal with some sweets — both recent additions, the creative and delicious Pandan Ice-cream Sandwich, features coconut ice cream sandwiched between puff pastry, pandan kaya and sprinkles of yuzu gel; and an intriguing Charcoal Pavlova teeming with fresh fromage blanc, lime sorbet and finished with lime zest and dried raspberries. Butcher Boy’s popular Sunday Roast continues to be available every Sunday from 12.00pm – 4.00pm.

Freshen things up with Haw Yeah! ($22++), an elevated take on the Ramos Gin Fizz with basil-infused gin laced with tropical elements of mango and cucumber. The Butterfly Effect abides by the Asian-inspired theme with a combination of butterfly pea flowers infused with vodka, in-house berry blend and ginger syrup. Those looking for a post-dinner option will enjoy Lucky No.7, made with a blend of Brandy, Kahlua & chocolate liqueur. House favourites retained on the menu include Cymbo, a fiery twist on the classic Margarita with the use of jalapeno-infused tequila and a slight hint of agave; as well as the spirit forward Negroni-inspired No.47; and Holy Smokes, a modern twist on the classic Old Fashioned with coffee infused blended malt whisky which is smoked to perfection with apple wood chips.

The Prawn Chatpata is a popular favourite, with juicy prawns cooked with black pepper, onions, and green chilli, and a dash of lime juice for that refreshing citrusy kick. Sop up the rich gravy with a selection of tandoori-grilled naan, available in classic flavours like cheese, garlic, and butter.

In the tradition of a true mezza, begin with a sharing platter of some of the most beautiful hummus in town: topped with a party of pine nuts, herbs, minced lamb, and olive oil, this creamy hummus, eaten with crisp pita, is heaven on earth. Alongside that, a mezze platter of Babaganoush, Labneh, Moussaka, and Arabic Salad, gives you extra pita-dipping options, and all this before the main course of grilled meats. From fragrant, smoky Lamb Kofta to tender Shish Taouk (chicken breast in a zesty marinade), nothing speaks of the Middle East quite like its stunning array of grilled, marinated meats. But it’s the charcoal-grilled Lamb Chops, paired with spicy harissa, grilled vegetables, and rice that makes for a truly climactic moment: the smoky, meaty flavours are brought out perfectly by the zingy harissa, and the meat comes off the bone in chewy, tender bites.

Chef Kenji's thoughtfully crafted discovery menus feature fresh produce, with meats and fish sourced and flown in from artisanal producers in Japan, and seasonal fresh vegetables from France. Highlights include Kenji's signature Amadai dish. The Amadai fish from Kyoto Prefecture is cooked in the traditional ""Matsukasayaki"" style where the scales are left on the fish and fried to a crisp resembling pine cones. This gives the fish a very unique combination of crispy and tender textures.

But away from the buzz of Circular Road, along the sedate walkways of South Bridge Road, an art-gallery-turned-sake-bar called Boruto has opened with a menu of inventive Asian-inspired tapas that is an outright rebellion to the notion of bar food."" -City Nomads
""Known as vault in Japanese, Boruto does not just boast about a comprehensive menu of exciting Japanese tapas, it has over 80 different sake brands, 50 of which are exclusively stocked here, including a woozy range of high-quality junmai daiginjo and daishiki."" -Asia Style Asia

</p></li><li><h5>ABOUT</h5><p>One of the first places in Singapore to make Mexican food hip and part of the buzzing nightlife at Clarke Quay, Cafe Iguana is a favourite among night-birds drawn to its high-energy atmosphere (helped along by joyful Mexican music played through the speaker), strong, frosty drinks, and friendly crowds. They’re famous for their well-endowed margaritas, including their house favourites that come in sweet and tart flavours like peach, lime, and Soursop, though more premium numbers, mixed up with top-shelf tequilas, are also available if you’re looking for something complex to nurse through the night. Before the binge-drinking, line your stomach with the hearty Mexican fare on offer. Think soft corn tacos filled with tender red snapper, fatty pork carnitas, or shredded steak, perfect with a dash of salsa and pico de gallo. If you’re looking for something heftier, full plates are available too, featuring chow like a Mulato Rib Eye, a chargrilled cut of Australian beef that’s intensified with Mexican spices and a fiery chili sauce, served alongside beans and rice. The house specialty is the Green Chile Stew, made with pork in a rich broth of chile verde, served with tortillas and rice, for a hearty, spicy centrepiece that’s perfect for sharing. Take down the heat with an icy margarita, or a smoky Mezcal cocktail, and soak up the riverside vibes: the night is only beginning.

Serving an eclectic menu from local to Japanese to European dishes, find something for everyone here at Q Classified. It's no secret that they incorporate fresh seafood into delicious dishes for every palate here. Try out their Japan Bay Oyster Omelette for a dish that combines premium ingredients with local flavours. Made with plump, fresh Japan Bay Oysters, this gooey dish is crispy on the outside and soft on the inside with oysters that burst in your mouth with fresh ocean flavour. Highly addictive, you might even call for more than one serving. The menu has a broad selection of sweet and savoury flavours so you can experience the different textures from each dish. One of their most popular menu items are their fluffy, chewy Baby Pancakes. Whether you prefer savoury or sweet pancakes, this is the perfect sharing dish. The star here is the Dutch Baby Pancake with Red Ruby topped with coconut ice cream. The bejeweled dish, with its striking tapioca cubes, is creamy and full of flavour with different textures coming together in perfect harmony, from chewy tapioca balls to soft ice cream. For mains, their Wagyu Rib Eye served with Foie Gras and Onsen Egg with Rice is a must try. Melt-in-your-mouth meat is paired with creamy foie gras that makes this dish an umami bomb. When paired with a steaming bowl of rice and egg, this dish is satisfying and filling without overpowering your taste buds with complex flavors. If you like seafood, you can’t go wrong with Lobster Uni Tagliatelle with Black Truffle. A luxurious dish, full of truffle aromas, this dish is naturally sweetened from the lobster and infused with ocean flavours from the creamy uni. A cold beverage like the well-known Korean Dalgona Coffee would be a nice addition to your meal to enhance it with its hint of roasted taste.

At Candlenut, this uniquely Southeast Asian cuisine is getting its time in the limelight thanks to chef-owner Malcolm Lee’s deft work and skill that garnered him a Michelin star two years in a row.  

With high ceilings, clean lines, and plenty of sunshine, it’s almost impossible to feel stressed in the relaxed and laidback atmosphere that Candlenut exudes. While this 92-seater establishment includes a private room for more intimate dinners, guests also have the option of sitting in the al fresco area for a night under the stars. 

There are a fair number of classic Peranakan dishes on a menu that spans across 40 appetisers, mains, and desserts. Be prepared to fall head over heels for standouts such as the Red Lion Snapper, accompanied by fresh chilli sambal and charred garlic chives. The King Tiger Prawn, featuring local ingredients such as gula melaka coconut sauce, lemongrass, and Thai basil, is also another hit. Of course, indecisive eaters can always go for the playfully-named Ah-Ma-Kase tasting menu to sample a little of everything. 

With a new home at the ultra-hip COMO Dempsey, Candlenut promises a night (or afternoon) filled with contemporary Straits-Chinese cuisine amid the lush greenery that is Dempsey Hill.

The vegetables are stewed 'til they achieve the perfect texture - a cross between chewy and melt-in-the-mouth."" -Time Out Singapore
""The food is also a reflection of Lee's deft use of ingredients from the South-East Asian pantry. Our wing bean salad is a refreshing crunch of red radish, prawns, cashews, lemongrass and crisp anchovies, all tossed in a zesty calamansi lime dressing. The sweet flesh of perfectly grilled king tiger prawns is complemented by a coconut sauce that is given extra depth with the addition of caramel-edged gula melaka."" -The Peak Singapore</p></li><li><h5>DISHES WE LOVE</h5><p>Homemade Kueh Pie Tee, Westholme Wagyu Beef Rib Rendang, Blue Swimmer Crab Curry, Buah Keluak Fried Rice, Red Lion Snapper Fillet with Black Green Mango Sambal, King Tiger Prawn with Fresh Chilli Sambal, Classic Chendol Cream, Textures of Coconut</p></li><li><h5>href</h5><p>https://www.chope.co/singapore-restaurants/restaurant/candlenut</p></li>","Candlenut","https://www.chope.co/singapore-restaurants/restaurant/candlenut",1

The idea is simple. You sit down, and passadors bearing skewers of grilled premium meat, carve moist slivers directly onto your plate. Beef, chicken, lamb, fish – there's no need to limit yourself. It's an endless flow of meaty goodness where all you have to do is sit, and eat. And eat. And eat. Just when your palate is starting to feel a little jaded, you order a portion of grilled caramelised pineapple whose sharp, tangy sweetness is the perfect way to whet your appetite all over again. All so you can get back to those delicious cuts of meat. 

Don't just be dazzled by the succulent barbecued meats, rotisserie-cooked to perfection. There's also a buffet spread that shouldn't be overlooked! With staples like salads and pastas, it's where you should turn to if you feel that you've met your match on the protein front. 

The meat though, is undeniably the draw of this restaurant, and with a name like Carnivore, that shouldn't be a surprise. 

Stationed near the archways of the iconic CHIJMES pavilion, this Carnivore outlet is undeniably unique. Softened by the backdrop of the gorgeous white chapel, the outdoor dining option here is a must, creating an incomparable ambience that makes this unique dinner experience all the more special. So sharpen those claws and polish those canines my friends, because there's no better place to meet.

In place of exposed brick and traditional white table cloths, Caruso features crisp, white stone arches, an airy bar and dining room, and bright citrus walls. Its concrete floors, sleek furniture and two storey-foyers are modern, while mainstays of Italy are sprinkled about, with poppy Italian tunes playing and vintage photos of the restaurant's namesake singer dotting the wall.
While the interiors exude an air of Southern Italy, the flavours from the dishes that fly out of the kitchens here will truly transport diners to the heart of Puglia at first bite. Start your meal right with La Burrata, Puglia’s renown burrata cheese with wild rocket and cherry tomatoes, or sink your teeth into the beautifully fresh and tart octopus salad Insalata Di Polipo. Follow that with famous lamb dishes that Puglia is famous for: the Pappardelle Con Ragu Di Agnello features slow braised lamb that’s cooked for 8 hours and served over homemade pasta, while Costolette Di Agnello Al Timo brings you gorgeous thyme-roasted lamb chops with artichokes, spinach, and roasted potatoes.
With the brilliant lightness of all the dishes, saving room for dessert isn't a concern. And with dessert just as light and perfect as the rest of the meal, we were left wishing it did not have to end.

Here, they offer a traditional multi-course Italian meal, which you kick off with some pasta, like the classic Spaghetti Alla Carbonara and little pillowy Ravioli stuffed with cheese and served with Parma ham, before diving into its meaty mains. Choose from dishes like a crisp-skinned Branzino al Pomodoro, a fillet of bass served with piquant capers and salty anchovies in a light tomato sauce, or a hefty Vitello Al Funghi Porcini, a tender veal loin grilled to perfection then dressed in a creamy porcini sauce, all delicious paired with one of the restaurant’s great beers or wines.

This all-day brunch concept cafe is also pet-friendly, so your furbabies can come along too. Diving straight into delicious brunch specials, go for their Chicken and Croffles Set to start off your day right. Soft and fragrant croffles are served with a side of butter maple syrup for an indulgent sweet treat and paired with delicious fried chicken that balances out the sweet with salty flavours. For a more local-inspired brunch favourite, go for the Otah Bruschetta. Fluffy sourdough is oven-baked with a spicy thick slab of moist muar otah and topped with gooey melted cheese to complete the dish. Hearty, spicy, and full of otah goodness, this toast is highly addictive with a fiery punch.Pasta dishes that shine through are their Sakura Cream Tagliatelle. Cooked with flavours of the ocean in mind, al-dente pasta is tossed in a creamy mentaiko sauce and topped with fresh seafood like clams and prawns, making this dish savoury and flavoured with the natural sweetness of the seafood. It’s also sprinkled with flakes of dried ebi on top for an extra dimension of flavour.For a healthier yet equally tasty option, go for their Spinach Cream Tagliatelle. The umami cheese cream sauce is cooked with tender spinach leaves and asparagus, creating a hearty dish that serves a delicate crunch. Topped with parmesan for an extra depth to its textures, this dish is scrumptious whilst allowing you to feast on the healthier side.For desserts, go for their fragrant and coconut-y Ondeh Ondeh Cake. Light and pillow-soft sponge cake is drizzled with sweet and fragrant gula melaka, and topped with roasted coconut flakes for added texture. Deliciously indulgent, finish off your meal on a sweet note with this pandan delight.

A full-fledged replica of the hit TV show's punnily-named Central Perk (after New York's Central Park, get it?) cafe is now taking waves of Friends fans on a nostalgic pilgrimage.
It's uncanny how true-to-life this cafe is, and you'll feel just like you're on the set of Friends with its weathered couch and cozy ambience. Sort through your romantic crises, tell silly stories, and fantasise about your favourite characters walking in through the door as you tuck into hearty plates with gourmet touches, cheekily named after characters and catchphrases from the show.
Joey's Fisherman Stew is a hearty pot of mussels, clams, octopus, salmon, and prawns in a rich, slow-cooked broth. Janice's Oh My God Baby Back Ribs features free range Iberico pork for an extra fatty, tender finish. Rachel fans will dig the appropriately healthy Rachel ""Green"" Salad, a Mediterranean toss-up of pesto, olives, feta, and compressed fruits. Roast chicken and Chandler devotees will enjoy Chandler's Thanksgiving, a gravy-doused bird served with a side of, ahem, ""Chanberry"" sauce.
It's all puns, good food, and fond TV memories here at Central Perk cafe, where you can recreate the show to your heart's content while tucking into great food and the enthusiastic company of other devotees.

There are many parts of the cafe that are photogenic and Insta-worthy too.

Kurry Korner is set to change that, however, with a wide variety of dishes that combine techniques and ingredients from all over India. Think Tandoori Chicken, Palak Paneer, and Vindaloo Curry.  Health-conscious diners will be happy to note that all the food here are free of MSG, artificial colours, and preservatives. The ingredients used are also fresh, which ensures that dishes are wholesome and delicious.

Whet your appetite with some Kurry Korner Chicken Soup. This Insta-worthy starter is just oozing with flavour. Made with chicken, thickened with cream, and spiced with garlic, the smell of this dish alone will have you salivating. Rich and earthy, this is the perfect pick-me-up on a rainy day or for when you just need some comfort food. For a taste of the South, try the Chettinad Chicken - a searing curry made with red chilli and sauteed coriander seeds best enjoyed with some steamed Basmati rice. 

Craving dessert? You can’t go wrong with the Gulab Jamun, caramelized milk dumplings floating in a sweet cardamom syrup. Every bite explodes with delightfully sweet filling, and makes for the perfect way to end your meal. (March 2019)

Sichuan food is known for its fiery flavours, but there are not a lot of restaurants that can serve up authentic nosh like this place can. From searing soup bases to healthy stews, there’s something for everyone at this centrally-located spot.

Adventurous patrons looking for the spiciest dish can refer to the number of chillies next to its name on the menu to gauge its spice level. Daredevils can start with the Secret Recipe Spring Frog, a delicious dish of chilli, frog meat, and a combination of secret sauces. The dish has a spicy, salty flavour that pairs perfectly with white rice. A little less ambitious? Start with the Griddle Cooked Trotters and work your way up.

Diners who wish to steer clear of the spice will be glad to know that there is a wide variety of healthy soups available. The Duck Soup with Sour Radish is a simple dish that is easy on the digestive system is a touted to have a “cooling” effect on the body. For something a little moreish, opt for the Chengdu Style Trotter Soup. This dish is richer due to the use of pork, and comes with a serving of vegetables.

The Smoked Salmon Salad is an excellent option for diners who are watching their waistlines. Made with tender pieces of smoked salmon tossed in crunchy greens, this dish is best enjoyed with one of their classic cocktails or the ever-popular Frozen Margarita. Not a fan of alcohol? Fear not, as the mocktail options are just as numerous. We like the Shirley Temple for it’s citrus flavour sweetened by a hint of Grenadine syrup. 

For something a little moreish, opt for the Sea Meets Land - the perfect dish for meat and seafood lovers. Think surf n’ turf, but more upscale - this dish is made with treasures from land, like foie gras and ribeye steak, as well as tiger prawns and scallops. This dish is large enough to be shared by two people. Don’t like sharing? Dig into one of their pasta dishes instead. The Crab Meat Marinara Spaghetti is a crowd favourite, and features juicy chunks of crab meat tossed in a tangy tomato sauce. (Oct 2018)

While the classic version holds a special place in our hearts (and stomachs), those who enjoy a little spice should head straight for their signature Spicy Up and the milder, sweeter YangNyum style. Fried chicken in Korea is often accompanied by alcohol beverages but those not looking to take advantage of the restaurant's beer and soju offerings can easily content themselves with a traditional bingsu dessert instead.

A scallop har gow, for instance, is not just a plump sliver of scallop wrapped in a starchy white parcel. Instead, you’ll find your ‘dim sum’ presented as a light, fluffy scallop mousse, piped onto a hotate shell with a layer of crab bisque. There’s something new to discover each time you have dinner at Chinoiserie. Chef Justin Quek is no stranger to fine dining cooking, and he’s taken his knowledge of French techniques and married it with his penchant for Asian flavours. 

Menus here are prix fixe or a la carte, and you’ll find seasonal ingredients like French Challan ducks and Manjimup black truffles. But rather than roasted in their own fat, the gamey ducks, are tossed in a wok and cooked over roaring flames to medium rare. Vegetables like artichokes and asparagus are stir-fried Asian-style, rather than served as a Western salad. 

Popular favourites here include a wild coral cod fillet, seared till the scales are crispy and served in a sweet-sour sauce, as well as French poussin stuffed with claypot rice. Leave room for the desserts — the banana flambé in rum and salted gula java ice cream is a great way to end an ever interesting meal.

Nigiri lovers should definitely kickstart their meal with the Tuna Nigiri and Shrimp Nigiri. Served atop expertly rolled rolls of fluffy short-grained rice, the fish is fatty and luscious while the prawns are juicy and succulent. The classic Salmon Nigiri is also not to be missed out on! Plump and slightly chewy, the slices of raw fish are perfectly seasoned. 

For those feeling adventurous, you can opt for the Kyoto Style Pressed Mackerel Sushi. Packed with black fungus and mushroom bits, the slices of sushi are fragrant and extremely flavourful. Fancier options include the Hanahitohira Set. This exquisite meal includes as many as 10 different sushi such as Ikura Gunkan and Tuna Otoro Nigiri alongside traditional favorites such as the Chawanmushi.

The all-day brunch plates offer the ultimate comfort food experience. Regular patrons swear by the Eggs Benedict, where two perfectly poached eggs and ham sit on toast, drizzled with creamy hollandaise sauce. For those who prefer something sweet to start the day, go for the French Toast that's drizzled in a berry compote, or pick from a selection of freshly-baked pastries.

Other quintessential French favourites include the Croque Monsieur, an open-faced ham sandwich topped with melted cheese, and the Quiche of the Day. No meal would be complete without a serving of their savoury Apple Tart with Vanilla Ice Cream, or the burnt goodness of a Crème Brûlée.

The cafe also doubles up as a baker, with homemade loaves displayed in rustic wooden baskets. You won't be able to resist picking up a few on your way home.

The structure is a sight to behold: through an ancient Chinese gateway with giant roaring lions guarding either side of its doors lies the Chui Huay Lim Club. Founded in 1845 as a place for prominent Teochew families to meet, you wouldn't guess the site's 166-year history from the brand new building that just opened in October.
The home of Singapore's oldest Teochew community club, you can be sure that dining at Chui Huay Lim Teochew Cuisine restaurant is one of the most authentic Teochew experiences possible. Run by the JUMBO Group of Restaurants, the food here has been refined to perfection by the keen eyes of generations of critical Teochew matriarchs. Classic dishes range from Cold Crab to Braised Duck, but for variety you'll also find some familiar favourites like Boiled Live Prawns and Chilli Crab. The seafood comes from tanks lining the restaurant, and was some of the best steamed pomfret the Chope Team has ever had. The house specialty though is clearly the Teochew Style Roasted Suckling Pig, which multi-generations seem to flock to the restaurant for day after day.
Chui Huay Lim Teochew Cuisine offers traditional cuisine in a comfortable and tasteful setting - a must-try dining experience for your entire family, and you don't even need to be a member of the club!

Now, experience incredible India not too far from home as Chutney Mary transports you there with their popular Indian street-style delights. 
We hear their piping hot chaats are consistent crowd favourites and we instantly see why. Choose from more than 10 options hailing from all across India, but we recommend the Bhel Puri, a tantalising combination of crispy flour pancakes and puffed rice served with onions and potatoes mixed with spices. Meat-lovers will enjoy the interesting selection of kebabs and scrumptious mains like Butter Chicken, Goan Prawn Curry and Raan Peshawari, a spring lamb leg marinated in yoghurt, herbs and spices. Vegetarians alike have a wide selection to choose from, but we say go for the Allu Gobi Mattar, a gorgeous dish of potatoes mixed with yummy cauliflower and green peas.
Pair your dishes with some Naan or Dum Biryani, wash it all down with a Mango Lassi, and there you go, satisfying Indian food at reasonable prices doesn’t take a trip to India to find! (Jul 2016)

If you're a nonna at heart, their extensive range of quality basics to more artisanal ingredients and drinks imported straight from Italy, will have you in raptures of joy. Neatly displayed in the modern store, the open wood and metal shelves stand out against the white exposed brick walls, and invite you to browse the aisles stocked with things you'd never find in our general supermarkets.
But as all good nonnas know, nothing beats actually trying the products. The good news is - you won't have to go far! Cibo cannily provides a menu of handmade dishes like Lasagna and Ravioli Porcini & Tartufo (homemade egg pasta stuffed with porcini and truffle in creamy sauce), appetisers like Tagliere di Addettati (a selection of cold cuts) and Puccia, their own special sourdough sandwich stuffed with Italian special varieties, as well as a long list of pizzas. If you're simply peckish, their fresh cheeses and wines make for a good snack as well.Perhaps this really is your first foray into specialised marts. In which case, Cibo's friendly staff, attractive mix of traditionally Italian items, modern grocer décor, and unpretentious Italian classics, will have you glad to say 'Ciao'.

How else to describe the dizzyingly gorgeous lobby, fluttering with hushed, 5-star service? You’d never know this spot once harboured one of the city’s original bustling ports of call for maritime trade. Since 1933, ships would be warmly greeted with savoury local specialties dished out by floating hawkers. Honouring that charming bit of history, The Clifford Pier acts as a showstopping backdrop for all-day Southeast Asian nibbles.It’s hard to imagine the glittery shores of Marina Bay hosting anything other than the sleek luxuries it's known for, The Fullerton Bay Hotel being its crown jewel. As such, it’s a lovely thought that The Clifford Pier pays respects to the rich tradition of the Bay’s enterprising currents, showcasing the best that Old Singapore has to offer then and now. And The Clifford Pier isn’t paying tribute with just a local-tinted menu, but rather a fully educated selection including rich Laksa, Soup Kambing, The Pier's Lobster Roll, Heritage Bites and Wagyu Rendang.However the homey cuisine doesn’t collide with the frothy aesthetic of the cavernous dining room. As if plucked from the set of a Baz Luhrmann film, the lushly appointed space is swathed in nautical hues of mineral blues, sandy buffs and rich textures. Under ivory arches with a view of the bay, the familiar cuisine at The Clifford Pier is just the opulence you’d expect from The Fullerton Bay Hotel.

Already a popular favourite amongst in-the-know brunch crowds here, the Singapore outlet at quiet Purvis Street offers an understated variation of the bustling New York experience.
All the classics from its savoury-sweet Southern-style brunch menu are here in Singapore: crispy-skinned and tender Buttermilk Fried Chicken served on maple-kissed waffles, and fluffy hotcakes slicked with warm maple butter then paired with your choice of tangy blueberry compote, chocolate chunks, or banana walnut.
What's brunch without some eggy indulgence? Other New York staples include the ubiquitous Eggs Benedict, here served over a crumbly Southern buttermilk biscuit, and hearty Huevos Rancheros - fried eggs in a party of Mexican beans, guacamole, sour cream, and tomato salsa, all topped with a heap of Monterey Jack, then broiled to cheesy perfection. The unspoken crowning glory here is the brunch cocktails you can get round the clock for that real ""Sex and the City"" touch of weekend revelry; Mimosas, Bellinis and Whisky Sours paired with your carby breakfast keep Brunch O' Clock going before you sensibly sober up with a bracing black coffee and hit the town.

The seven kitchens and accompanying 'live cooking stations' highlight the best of local cuisines and include Chinese, Indian, Indonesian, Malaysian, and Western dishes. You'll be inundated with choice - fresh seafood, perfectly grilled meats, laksa and other signature Singaporean dishes, dim sum, breads baked the traditional Tandoor way, and a wide variety of pastries and desserts. Wash it all down with refreshing juices or seek out Colony's resident mixologist to whip up specialty cocktails like the ""Bengal Brew"" or the ""Governor's Invitation"".

Named after the great explorer Christopher Columbus, this sizeable spot serves up dishes inspired by a range of cuisines - this is not your usual cafe fare.

The Soft-Shell Crab Burger is a crowd favourite, and for good reason. Fluffy brioche buns encase a crisp deep-fried soft shell crab patty topped with delicious furikake eggs and caramelised onions. The curly fries on the side go perfectly with the rich burger. Another popular, albeit lighter, option is the Salmon Soba Noodles. Made with poached salmon, bouncy soba noodles, and topped with cilantro-lime nori yogurt, this dish is tangy, gentle on the palate, and won’t undo any diet plans you may have. For something a little sweeter, opt for the Candied Bacon Buttermilk Waffle, a soft waffle served with bacon that has been tossed in sugar - the unique sweet and salty flavour combined with the tenderness of the waffle makes for a delicious and memorable dish.

Cafe junkies after their caffeine fix will be glad to know that Columbus offers specialty coffee from local roasters Two Degrees North. From a smooth latte to a sophisticated v60 filter brew,  the rigorous standards and consistency held by the team is the foundation of their success.  (Oct 2018)

Start off with a serving of Chile Con Queso, an addictive combination of jalapenos, melted red cheddar and jack cheese, as well as onions and tomatoes. This one will tickle your taste-buds and get your appetite all whetted and raring to go. For your main, you can’t go wrong with a good helping of Carnitas, or traditional Mexican pulled pork. This yummy dish comes with warm corn tortillas, salsa rojas, salsa verde, and guacamole – a real scrumptious option that’s worth every cent, if you ask us. Finish off on a high note when you scarf down a sweet treat such as the Kahlua Tiramisu, which gives a distinctively Mexican twist to this beloved Italian classic.

For something a little moreish, be sure to try the Chicken Aglio Olio, a light dish of linguine topped with smoky grilled chicken and seasoned with chilli flakes. Lightly spicy, flavourful, and filling, this is a great option for lunch. Watching your waistline? The Spanish Flying Fish might be what you need.

That’s the philosophy underpinning the cooking at COMO Cuisine, a dining establishment that formerly existed as a pop-up but has now found a permanent home on the chic grounds of COMO Dempsey. 

By drawing inspiration from the region’s rich culinary heritage, the restaurant surprises and astounds with its clever use of Asian ingredients and techniques. Perennial favourites include the heaping Our Big Raw Salad, which features a guilt-free indulgence of fresh and raw fruits and vegetables. There are a number of featured dishes inspired by the Indian subcontinent, such as the crunchy Samosas stuffed with spiced lamb and topped with a sweet and tangy mango chutney. Or opt for the Lamb Kofta, which has a hint of smokiness from the tandoor that’s fired by coconut charcoal. To make dining a family-friendly affair, the restaurant shies away from predictable kids’ menus. Instead, COMO Cuisine encourages young diners to expand their palates by choosing any dish that is served in a smaller portion. 

Designed by Italian architect and designer, Paola Navone, COMO Cuisine’s decor is a stunning interplay of light and elegant elements to make you feel comfortable and relaxed. Come for the innovative food, but stay for the warm ambience and truly exceptional dining experience that makes you feel like royalty. (Aug 2017)

Established in 2001, the Coriander Leaf brand is one of the most recognised names in Singapore’s food and beverage industry, and with its delectable Pan-Asian cuisine, it comes as no surprise!

The menu is divided into five flavour profiles: fresh, familiar, spicy, umami, and sweet.  While each dish is amazing, the standout is the Samia’s Signature Frontier Chicken with Coriander Seeds, Chilli , Yoghurt Cream, Arugula, and Lemon - it’s a dish that guests return to Coriander Leaf for time and time again! Otherwise, the Charcoal Grilled Baby Lamb Chops, Harissa, Yoghurt, Dried Chilli Paste, Pickled Onions is a crowd favourite too! The mélange of flavours ranging from the spicy dried chilli paste to the zesty harissa, sour pickled onions and milky and creamy yoghurt is truly a treat for your stomach! With time-tested dishes that have diners returning for more, it’s no wonder that Coriander Leaf stayed on as one of Singapore’s most loved restaurants! (May 2017)

“Unsurprisingly, the standouts are dishes that have a personal connection to both Ahad and Latiff. The charcoal-grilled baby lamb chops (S$29) marinated in harissa, yoghurt and dried chilli paste, which made its way over from the previous menu, is consistently succulent, tender and flavoured with just enough heat, spice and acidity.” -Today

wine aficionado Renny Heng. Its name references the eminent botanist E.J.H. Corner, whose former
abode is now a fabled, irreplaceable Black and White Colonial House and the sophisticated setting
for a Michelin-starred restaurant. Its location in the UNESCO World Heritage Site Botanic Gardens
sets the stage for a multi-layered meal that combines its storied past, the botanical bounty of the
world, and a future that looks towards exhilarating, modern French-Asian interpretations by
Executive Chef David Thien from Bordeaux</p></li><li><h5>PRESS RELEASE</h5><p>Since taking the helm of Corner House in March, just two weeks before stringent Covid-19 measures
took hold of the island-state, Executive Chef David Thien has spent his time dreaming up culinary journeys for returning guests. Even while the restaurant team contributed to feeding frontline heroes during this period, Chef Thien was inspired to compose a poem for the description of a mystery dish. Finally, with the lifting of dining-in restrictions on 19 June, Corner House is thrilled to reopen to the public with a daringly original new menu that showcases its prowess in contemporary seasonal cuisine.
Since its opening in 2014, Corner House has earned multiple recognitions including the award of one-Michelin-star since 2016 and a rise to #42 on Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants 2020 list. The
appointment of French-Chinese-Mauritian David Thien ushers in a fresh perspective as he debuts an exploratory world of fine flavors, inspired by his adopted home of Singapore since 2007.
The eagerly anticipated new menu at Corner House showcases intimate sessions where Chef Thien prepares dishes inspired by personal stories, thoughts, and memories. The dining experience is designed to inspire and surprise. He elaborates, “My hope is that guests develop a deeper
appreciation and connection with the food that they eat, relishing the thought behind it.”
The menu continues to be organized by three, five, and seven-course sets for lunch, and five, seven, and chef’s course for dinner. Guests are presented with chapters authored by chefs, detailing stories
accompanied by visuals that delve into each ingredient or concept. The menu is dynamic and everchanging to adapt to the seasons, sources, and customers. (Jun 2020)</p></li><li><h5>THE BUZZ</h5><p>Singapore Michelin Guide 1 Star - 2016, 2017, 2018

Wash it all down with fresh juices, or a Belgian Trappist beer. (Apr 2019)

No surprises there since even the name draws inspiration from the dining table, a central anchor in the life of a typical Chinese family.
Likewise, the menu features plenty of favourites and an abundance of sets that might make ordering for your passel of folks that much easier. Think Baked Crab Shell stuffed with Seafood Paste, Sautéed Beef Cube in Black Pepper Sauce, Deep Fried Butter Prawn, Braised Ee-fu Noodle with Live Prawn in Black Truffle Oil and Pan-fried Kurobuta Pork Chop with Teriyaki Sauce. It’s a smorgasbord of delectable items ranging from the tried-and-tested abalone and fresh seafood to meats and vegetarian creations jam packed with flavour. The name ‘Crystal Jade’ is a crowd favourite in all its iterations and, given the quality and ambience of Crystal Jade Dining IN, it looks like its stellar track record remains yet to be beat!

In true Crystal Jade style, the décor boasts neutral colours, underscored by shades of berry, and eye-catching light stands. It's a timeless ambience, bold enough to have you steeped in admiration, but subtle enough that it doesn't take away from the main highlight - the food.
It is the modern, prettily plated Chinese dishes that are, for the most part, comforting in their familiarity, but will occasionally throw you for a loop with unexpected ingredients or presentations. Hint: some of the dim sum pastries come in quirky forms! Sample the Combination of Chilled Foie Gras with Japanese Sake, Chilled Abalone & Crab Meat Salad, or Sautéed Carrot Cake with XO Sauce.
Like some of its other sibling restaurants, the menu boasts multiple pages dedicated to a variety of premium ingredients, from bird's nest, abalone, and shark's fin to exquisite soups like Buddha Jumps Over The Wall and live seafood such as lobster, Sri Lankan crab, or succulent prawns and fishes. The selection is truly vast - a blessing when catering to a range of tastes and diets - and the urge to order more than you can stomach will be strong.
The next time a family occasion rolls around, this restaurant should top your list of places to go!

As Pisan cooking embodies traditional rustic recipes combining influence from all over Italy, Curate Cucina Pisana retains this diversity of Pisan cooking while introducing a modern and comforting home-cooked twist to its dishes. Apart from using seasonal seafood from both Pisa’s coastal regions, the restaurant will also feature hearty and rich flavours of its seasonal game meats and game birds such as venison, pigeon and quails from its mountainside. The beauty of Pisa lies in its cuisine that pairs beautifully with the magnificent wines from the province, all of which can be experienced in Singapore’s very own Curate Cucina Pisana. Only at Curate Cucina Pisana will guests be introduced to the finest Pisan produce specially imported from the region. From prized truffles specially sourced from the three-generational family-owned Savini Tartufi farm in the province of Pisa, to top quality olive oil originating from the hilly terrains of the Pisan mountains, unique Tuscan cured meats well known for their incredible savoriness, and the coveted Pecorino and cheeses from the town of Volterra, the restaurant takes its guest on a gastronomical journey around the Pisa province. For lovers of pasta, Curate Cucina Pisana brings to table freshly hand-made pasta made from the best Italian Durum wheat Semolina, as well as traditional pasta from the Martelli, a family-run pasta business that still retains its pasta-making traditions since 1926. At Curate Cucina Pisana, Chef de Cuisine Davide Bizzarri will showcase delicious artisanal produce from his hometown of Pisa and its neighboring locale in his cooking. Inspired by his childhood growing up in Pisa, where cooking is a daily family affair that is deeply ingrained in the Pisan way of life, Chef Bizzarri aspires to bring authentic Pisan passion in home-cooked delicacies to Curate Cucina Pisana. By creating this sense of coziness and comfort in the culinary experience at the restaurant, diners will leave with their hearts and bellies full. Having obtained two culinary degrees in Pisa under the guidance of famed Chef Andrea Lorenzi and trained under the direction of renowned celebrity chef brothers Enrico and Roberto Cerea for five years, Chef Bizzarri will combine his refined culinary expertise with fresh seasonal ingredients to create an unforgettable taste of home in Pisa throughout the seasons.

Timber furniture, carved wooden screens, red cloth aplenty, you half expect an epic fight to break out in Dian Xiao Er, with kungfu kicks and wine barrels flying around.

Except the only fight one can imagine here is over the famous Herbal Roasted Duck that has been the mainstay of the Dian Xiao Er menu for the last 12 years. The dark herbal gravy that the duck comes bathed in is made of 10 Chinese herbs that include codonopsis root, foxglove root, and licorice root. This gravy is said to have a calming effect while relieving mental stress and revitalizing energy. We were definitely very energized after eating this duck, not least because of its succulence and moistness. The duck skin itself is also crispy and adds a satisfying crunch to the dish. Paired with fragrant steamed rice, the flavours of this dish are strong, but not overpowering. 

Try the other dishes on the menu as well; Dian Xiao Er specializes in traditional Chinese comfort food such as melt-in-the-mouth Dong Po Pork and refreshing Silver Cod Fish in Superior Soy Sauce. For a taste of traditional Chinese inn food, Dian Xiao Er is the place to go.

The hostess then gestures you toward the beer fridge as if to offer you a drink. But instead of pulling out a tasty cold brew, the fridge door opens up into a portal into another realm like something out of a real-life Alice in Wonderland. “This is where you must continue alone,” says the hostess, as the fridge door opens into a street alley that transports you into the braised underbelly of the “Long Tang” that is The Dragon Chamber. Things are not always as they appear.
Secretly located within a brightly coloured Kopitiam, The Dragon Chamber is a hidden restaurant. What may look like a regular beer fridge in a kopitiam is actually a secret door that opens up into its own inner recesses. Reminiscent of Chinatown gambling dens and secret society hangouts, the walls of The Dragon Chamber are covered with artwork from local and regional artists such as Sabotage, Mister Tucks, and Riandy Karuniawan, referencing past and recent Chinese tradition from a globalist, counter-culture point of view.
The Dragon Chamber offers an unconventional menu serving “guerilla style” food, representing dishes that are not typical banquet style Chinese food. Among its own wild concoctions from The Dragon Chamber’s test kitchen, the underground restaurant also brings back age-old Chinese dishes that never caught on in mainstream restaurants, because of unconventional ingredients. Yet the flavours are immense. Contrasting lovable Chinese-American recipes, The Dragon Chamber pushes the diner’s comfort zone with adventurous dishes that may even shock diners with unusual Chinese techniques of nose-to-tail animal preparation. One such dish is the Dragon’s Claw. Touted as one of the restaurant’s signature dishes, it features a Crocodile Foot braised in Chinese herbs, served on a bed of greens and a literal ring of fire. Bearing a taste similarly close to chicken, the meat is tender and sweet. Its skin is painstakingly descaled with a torch, revealing a thick and rich layer of collagen that coats the succulent herb-marinated meat with a soft and sticky texture, adding a consistent mouthfeel to every bite. If crocodile foot and mammal innards might be too adventurous for some, we also offer more conventional favourites such as Firecracker Chicken and Wagyu Truffle Hor Fun.
Not a space for political correctness and mellow elevator music, the restaurant recommends not bringing any overtly conservative in-laws you might have. Make your way down to The Dragon Chamber, we dare you to enter the bowels of Chinese cuisine to discover your true gastronomic self.

Open with a classic Cold Cut Charcuterie Board, a playground of your favourite cured meats including pork rillettes, chorizo, and salami, served up with crunchy cornichons and artisanal bread. There’s also an Artisanal Cheese Platter to go with the bright, robust wines on offer from the shelves. 

Mains here come in the form of smoky grilled meats. Think hearty steaks like the Grilled Ribeye served with a medley of seasonal vegetables and red wine jus, or the New Zealand Rack of Lamb served up with French ratatouille and a salad of puffed rice. Other mains take a more British gastropub turn, with a Classic Fish & Chips, featuring beer battered Sea Bass, and Bangers & Mash made with fatty Kurobuta Pork Toulouse Sausages, crowning the menu. Dessert is a classic Chocolate Lava Cake affair, though you should also get the Raspberry Dome, an elegant, tangy confection, and make a double-dessert night of it. After all, this place is all about sharing, and with vibes this good, you’ll definitely want to bring a friend or two along for the ride. (Jan 2018)

Adding on to the widely-received sourdough-centered menu conceived back in its Le Vin Levain days, diners can first line their bellies with snacks including the anchoring signature Sourdough Karaage (S$20) for a juicy crunch of slow-marinated then sourdough battered chicken thigh chunks with a zingy homemade kimchi mayo; seasoned and skewered Prawn Sticks (S$20) that are best enjoyed with drizzles of smoke paprika aioli, and a perennial Sharing Spread Platter (S$22) of pita bread served alongside a hearty trio of avocado cream, pumpkin hummus and seeds praline for dips.Indubitably integral to the experience at Drunken Farmer is its diverse and ever-growing collection of natural wines that span across the spectrum of red, white, rosé, orange and sparkling. Wine lovers in search for a convivial watering hole in the east can look forward to a rotation of 14 labels available by-theglass (from S$18) for fresh discoveries at every return, or have their pick from a bottle selection of over 80 labels (from S$87) that is well on its way to offering the largest selection of orange wines and pèt-nat in Singapore. For the unintiated or adventurous, the Farmer’s Selection (S$50) offers three glasses curated by our natural wine experts to help begin your natural wine journey or simply pair with your meal.

The Dum Pukht cooking uses a round heavy-bottomed pot. There are two main aspects to this style of cooking, roasting and maturing of a prepared dish.In this style of cuisine, herbs and spices play an important role. The process of slow roasting gently releases maximum flavour. The sealing of the Handi's lid is wrapped with dough to achieve maturing. Cooking slowly in its juices, the food retains all its natural aromas and becomes imbued with the richness of flavours that distinguishes the dish. Par-cooked food is kept in Handi with a minimal amount of water. The lid is placed and sealed with a paste of flour and water. The flames are put out, leaving a bed of hot coals. The heat creates the steam, the steam condenses and rolls down the curved walls. In other words, the steam is choked before it can escape, leading to the term 'Dum Pukht'.

The charming nautical-themed decor and handsome wooden touches throw you straight into a seafaring fantasy right in the middle of King Albert Park. It’s the perfect mid-shopping getaway for those tired feet and hunger pangs: expect comforting nosh and hearty cafe grub, alongside an invigorating cup of strong coffee. Except this isn’t your usual cafe fare. There’s a healthy amount of kitchen wizardry at work here. Think of hefty appetizers like their signature Treasures in a Bun, a pillowy steamed bun stuffed with slow-braised pork belly done up with caramelized ginger chili sauce and crunchy fried shallots. This is matched with fiery Thai-influenced salads like the Pomelo Pick Me Up, a salad of tender poached prawns tossed in a zingy sweet chili lime dressing, dressed with peanuts, and scattered with tart pomelo gems for a true party in the mouth.
Mains here go straight to comfort food territory with numbers like the Lobster Submarine, a buttery roll filled with poached lobster that’s dressed with lemony mayo, crunchy tobiko, and crunchy vegetables. For something even heftier, and more indulgent, get the Foie Gras Wagyu Burger, which hits all the luxury eating sweet spots: meltingly fatty foie gras crowns a juicy Wagyu patty that’s sandwiched between fluffy brioche buns and held together by a lovely onion marmalade and mushrooms. If there’s room for dessert, the Chocolate Cherry Dome, a beautiful confection of chocolate, berries compote, strawberries, and meringue, will seal the deal on your visit. Pop by for their High Tea too for tiers of similarly elegant desserts and a quiet afternoon in one of the city’s most charming neighbourhoods.

Located just steps from the iconic Buddha Tooth Relic Temple, this eatery has a menu that could easily convert any carnivore. The restaurant’s motto, meatless does not mean tasteless, is echoed in many of the menu items, which are made with plant-based meat alternatives that are just as good, if not better than the original.

The Marmite Vegetarian Pork Ribs are a chef specialty, and made with soy and yeast extract. While it may not sound very appealing, the combination of rich soy meat and earthy Marmite makes for a delectable combination - perfect as a snack or as an accompaniment to some freshly steamed jasmine rice.

Another dish worth trying is the Vegetarian Peking Duck. The clever use of fresh yam fried to crisp perfection to make the “duck meat” and the delicious taste of the of the dish itself are enough to convince you that you’re chowing down on real meat. Hankering for some treasures of the sea? Fret not, as they’ve got that on the menu as well. Try the Thai Sauce Cod Fish - a spicy sour dish of mock fish meat doused in a Thai-inspired dressing.

But with nightlife legends like Employees Only leading the charge, there’s very little to complain about. Loved by night owls in New York for its kooky, offbeat service, strong classic cocktails, and delicious comfort food, this West Village institution is now in Singapore, headed by one of the original bosses, the affable Igor Hadzismajlovic. Employees Only’s Singapore outpost is the bar’s first such international undertaking, and has landed at swish Amoy Street, to join the belt-of-sin’s constellation of upmarket speakeasies.
Past the friendly door-keeps, you’re greeted by a surly, turban-wearing fortune teller (don’t ask) before you go through velvet curtains into a Moulin-Rouge-esque carnival of raucous chatter, Motown, and the chaotic sounds of a busy bar. The crowd is one of the friendliest in town, standing-room only on the best of nights with plenty of good booze to keep conversations going. Sip on one of the bar’s superb classic Manhattans as you scoot over to your table and sit down to a supper of comforting favourites like the joint’s famous Bone Marrow Poppers and Hand Cut Steak Tartare. Earlier in the night, dinner plates include a Roasted Half Chicken adorned with cauliflower, capers, and parsley, a tender Porterhouse Pork Chop with black eyed peas and savoy cabbage, and a grilled Whole Rainbow Trout.
But with accolades including Spirited Awards’ “World’s Best Cocktail Bar”, Employees Only Singapore guides your focus to the well trained bar-team, led by veteran bartender Steve Schneider, which turns out classic cocktails and new signatures made from a hefty selection of boutique spirits, house-made syrups, tinctures, and other goodies. Employees Only is all good: the vibes, the food, the drink, and, employees or not, we’re glad it’s in Singapore!

Offering up waterfront dining, the restaurant boasts an excellent view of the Singapore River. A theme of mixing old and new flows throughout the restaurant and nicely echoes the design philosophy of the museum. It's contemporary interior and vibrant décor contrasts with the colonial facade, and diners will surely enjoy the juxtaposition of casual dining whilst nestled in the confines of a formal museum.
This trend continues with the menu. EMPRESS features dishes that are a mainstay of Cantonese cuisine but does so in a way that blends good ole' Cantonese flavours with more modern touches. Don't worry, you'll still be able to recognize items from dim sum to their signature roast meats. Speaking of which, the Triple Roast Platter, which showcases Spare Ribs, Char Siew, and Roast Pork, all of which are carefully cooked to retain that perfect level of juiciness, is a team favourite! EMPRESS is also one of the first few restaurants in Singapore to give an Asian-slant to Impossible Meat – the Impossible Meat Gyozas and Kway Teow are truly delicious. EMPRESS also bucks convention with their Western-style salads and plated desserts including the decadent Sticky Date & Longan Pudding. On weekends and public holidays, EMPRESS also offers a sumptuous dim sum buffet which you can pair with champagne for an indulgent treat.
All in all, EMPRESS hopes to eradicate the notion that Cantonese cuisine can be a bit stuffy, and you'll no doubt agree once you experience the relaxed environment and accessible dishes.

Lush green foliage at the entrance gives way to dimly-lit interiors decked with Terry O’Neill photographs, while jazz music plays softly in the background. 
 
From the menu comes British classics like fish and chips and beef wellington. The former is no greasy battered fish served in a newspaper cone; instead, White brings in top-grade English turbot, lightly-battered and served with thick, golden chips cooked in beef fat. Order mains like the Grilled Rib of Black Angus Beef and the Honey Roast Belly Pork Marco Polo to share. The Honey Roast Pork Belly comes piping hot in a claypot, where four generous slabs of unctuous meat lie on a bed of fried kway teow. The smoky rice noodles, together with the marbled meat and crunchy pieces of crackling are a wonderful combination that will keep you coming back for more. 

Save some space for desserts — portions are dainty enough to have one all by yourself. Top picks include a wobbly English Egg Custard that tastes like a refined egg tart, or opt for a lighter dish of Champagne Poached Pear with a luscious creme vanilla.

From the twinkling lights illuminating the signboard to the pop art illustrations of Chinese ladies with coiffed hair adorning the menu, stepping into this restaurant is like going back in time. The concept may be dated, but the food certainly isn’t. Founded solely on the principle of enjoying life while it lasts, this spot serves up delicious nosh at an affordable price.

Chef-Owner Joel lives by one principle, and that is making the most of precious moments by enjoying some of the best food life has to offer. Therefore it’s no surprise that the menu here consists of hearty local comfort food such as the Singapore Style Chilli Prawns, Grandma's Te Kah Bee Hoon, and XO White Fish Soup.

The Curry Chicken is a must-try. The chicken is cooked in a special blend of spices till it is tender enough to fall off the bone, giving the dish a richness that is reminiscent of zi char stalls in the olden days. The Grandma's Te Kah Bee Hoon is a great option for diners who love hawker food. Made with thin stands of vermicelli tossed in a smoky, savoury homemade sauce, and topped with a generous portion of melt-in-your-mouth braised pork, this is the perfect dish to warm you up on a cold day.

Taking pride in presentation, Entrance has come up with a creative and avant-garde menu of cocktails to boast. Diners can expect an experience like no other as they feast on a liquid buffet of cocktails that pairs so well with their Japanese-European menu. Snack on their nori seaweed, a tasty, crunchy delight that’s great to pick on as you sip on perfectly executed cocktails. Our favourite is their Matcha Trance, an elegant green drink with notes of bittersweet matcha. Looking for more than a snack? Entrance’s Salmon Tacos are addictively good. Enjoy the taste of smoky salmon mixed with your usual toppings all in a single taco shell. Pair this with a lovely Elderflower Haku Cocktail for a floral and refreshing taste, or go for something stronger with their Entrance Gin Roll. For a meatier option, try out their Jamon Iberico Brioche, a buttery toasted bun with slices of Iberico shaved on top. It’s the ultimate indulgence — we recommend pairing this with a Yogin Dark Sea Salt Crumble to complement the salty and savoury flavours.

With nostalgic Spanish kitchen curios and rough-hewn textures, the final product is a modern depiction of an urban canteen in Seville.
Esquina has seen two chef changes since its founding, but the tradition of strong flavours and Spanish flair continues on with Executive Chef Carlos Montobbio. Born in Barcelona, the 28 year old has over ten years of experience despite his youth, including time spent in Michelin-starred restaurants, which accounts for the sophistication of the food and plating.
While the second storey offers a quieter and equally quaint setting, you might prefer to sit around the frenetic open kitchen on the ground floor to marvel at the works of art being created not two feet away. Perfectly tender Grilled Spanish Octopus, the deceptively plain-sounding Spanish Omelette, and more unique Wagyu Beef Intercostals are just a few of the delicious plates you can find on the six-sectioned menu. The tiny digs may leave you without a seat if you haven't made a reservation, but Esquina is definitely worth the wait. (Jan 2016)</p></li><li><h5>THE BUZZ</h5><p>
""Labeling Esquina's food simply as ""tapas"" doesn't seem to do it justice. The dishes are gastronomic and visual works of sheer creativity, skill and passion. One of the dishes that has remained on the menu is the Spanish Breakfast - a slow cooked egg served with bravas sauce, cubed and creamed potato and crispy Iberico ham. If you're looking for an authentic taste of Spain in this tapas bar, then this is the perfect dish for you."" -Asia Tatler Dining
""The concise placemat menu, augmented by a counter of daily fish and seafood specials, is overseen by executive chef Andrew Walsh, a former Pollen Street Social sous-chef. The food is an interesting interplay of classic and playful. There's a nicely textured but unseasoned Spanish classic omelette, or a gooey-good slow-cooked egg with bravas tomato sauce, potatoes and crispy jamon iberico."" -Time Out Singapore</p></li><li><h5>DISHES WE LOVE</h5><p>Grilled Spanish Octopus, Esquina's Spanish Omelette, Crispy Baby Squid, Sardines with Samfaina, Pigeon with Forest Berries Escabeche, Basil Sorbet & Strawberries</p></li><li><h5>TRIPADVISOR CERTIFICATE OF EXCELLENCE</h5><p>This restaurant was awarded the TripAdvisor Certificate of Excellence in 2015 and 2017 for its outstanding service and quality while maintaining as a favourite among reviewers on TripAdvisor, the world's largest travel site.</p></li><li><h5>href</h5><p>https://www.chope.co/singapore-restaurants/restaurant/esquina</p></li>","Esquina","https://www.chope.co/singapore-restaurants/restaurant/esquina",1

The name ‘Euphoria’ and the Chinese character ‘<U+5FC6>’ in the logo convey the promise of delight, wonderment, and enduring memory awaiting the diner. With Restaurant Euphoria, Chef Jason introduces Gastro-Botanica 2.0,  the elevated iteration of his original cuisine that showcases carefully sourced and prepared premium vegetables, meats and seafood, where prominence and elaboration are given to botanical elements of vegetables, tubers, herbs, spices, and fruits. 
Version 2.0 introduces botanical essences to create base sauces known as Gastro-Botanica Essences – La Symphonie de Légumes. In doing so, Chef Jason radically departs from the foundational ‘mother sauces’ of French haute cuisine, thus blazing the trail for further innovation. Euphoria features completely new 2.0 creations, along with Chef Jason’s signature dish of the Cévennes onion in four ways called ‘My Favourite Vegetable’. Located in vibrant Tras Street, the restaurant recreates a lush garden within its heritage shophouse interior, setting the stage for a gastronomic journey with a ground-breaking chef at the peak of his craft.</p></li><li><h5>DISHES WE LOVE</h5><p>Oignon doux des Cévennes, Oignon Jamboree, Maine Lobster, Patin Fish</p></li><li><h5>href</h5><p>https://www.chope.co/singapore-restaurants/restaurant/euphoria</p></li>","Euphoria","https://www.chope.co/singapore-restaurants/restaurant/euphoria",1

But, head to Famous Treasure for a taste of lesser-known dishes that are a nod to Singapore’s melting pot of cultures. Dinner starts with little saucers of tangy pickled papaya and sour plum-infused tomatoes that are meant to whet your appetite for the savoury plates to come. A dish of Steamed Empress Chicken is a well-loved Cantonese favourite. The fresh, plump chicken is lightly salted and steamed, drizzled with Shaoxing wine and soya sauce, then garnished with julienned ginger for a hint of heat. Also, try the Whole Steamed Fish with sour preserved vegetables, peanuts, and roast pork in a brown sauce for an uncommon pairing of ingredients.

Carbs are a must-have at every Chinese restaurant, and the Teochew-style Kway Teow Fried with Chye Poh and Kai Lan is a humble dish redolent with wok hei (a complex, charred aroma). The flat rice noodles are tossed with preserved radish and chopped Chinese broccoli, then skillfully cooked at high heat over roaring flames for that deep, smoke-kissed flavour. 

Apart from its extensive food menu, Famous Treasure also offers a vast selection of wines and whiskies, including limited editions such as a Balvenie 30-year-old Scotch as well as a 30-year-old Glenglassaugh. Sip on these rich, smoky spirits that are the perfect complement to a meal here. (Feb 2019)

Start the meal on a refreshing note with dishes such as tuna ceviche dressed in a zesty calamansi vinaigrette. If you want something more, go all out for indulgent French classics like the Burgundy Escargots Baked in Garlic Herb Butter, or Pan-Seared Foie Gras With Apple Chutney and Blinis. 

Meat-lovers are in for a treat at Farangse, which leans towards a beef-centric menu. Tuck into the Braised Beef Cheek with Red Wine and Mushrooms, a flavourful dish where the meat is simmered in a rich wine sauce until fork-tender and paired with earthy mushrooms, for a treat. Steaks are also done well in this French-Issan outfit, with crowd favourites such as grass-fed beef striploin and tenderloin char-grilled to perfection and served with a dollop of silky mash. Another favourite is the grilled iberico pork, dressed in lashings of honey and sweet roasted vegetables on the side. Be sure to save some space for dessert as well - the warm apple tart with a scoop of house-made vanilla ice cream is reminiscent of grandma’s cooking. For a fusion sweet treat, go for the Thai mango sticky rice. (May 2019)

The extensive menu features perennial favourites like Chinese barbecued meats and dim sum, as well as nourishing double-boiled soups that are a staple in Cantonese cuisine. The Double-Boiled Black Chicken Soup with Fish Maw and Cordyceps Flower is lovingly prepared from a stock of Chinese Jin Hua ham, pork shoulder, and old fowl that is simmered over low heat for six hours to coax out deep, rich flavours. For mains, the signature dishes at Feng Shui Inn are a must-try. Chilled Prawn with Lemon Sauce is given a modern twist with a side of fluffy lobster pancakes, drizzled with salted egg yolk and buttercream sauce. Order also the Pan-Fried Wagyu Beef in Teriyaki Sauce, where cubes of tender and juicy medium-rare steak are tossed in a sweet sauce. Other must-tries include Pan-Seared Japanese Kurobuta Pork Loin, as well as Roast Quail Drumstick in Black Truffle Sauce. For carb-loves, ‘Kampong Uncle’ Fried Rice in Hot Pot is a sizzling dish with delicious crispy bits at the bottom of the claypot. End the meal on a sweet note with traditional desserts like Double-Boiled Hashima with Red Dates and Double-Boiled Almond Cream with Glutinous Rice Balls.

Enjoy the best grilled meats in town while drinking some beer at The Fine Line. Start off your meal with the Steamed White Clams, despite being a main course in itself. Cooked in a white wine sauce and served with white bread, this hearty dish is perfect for sharing and best eaten hot. For a heavier option, go for their Australian Home Stead Sirloin that’s served with your sauce of choice and grilled for the smoky flavour that enhances the flavour of the prime cut. Alternatively, go for their New Zealand Lamb Rack that’s melt-in-your-mouth tender and full of thick, juicy goodness you can’t get enough of with each bite. Pizzas are a must-try here, and they go hard on the flavour department. A crowd favourite - Prosciutto De Parma, is made with tangy tomato sauce, arugula and generously topped with thin, savoury and salty slices of Prosciutto ham. For a vegetarian option that’s just as equally delicious, opt for the Assorted Mushroom Pizza that brings delightful earthy flavours together with truffle cream and cheesy mozzarella. In addition to their regular pasta offerings, their Beef Bolognese is a particular standout. Classic minced beef that’s juicy, mixed with a perfect pomodoro sauce and topped with Parmesan cheese, this dish is a force to be reckoned with in the flavour department and is something you can never go wrong with. With its extensive drink menu, you can find a beverage to suit your every need, from Draft, Craft, and Bottled Beers, to Spirits and Champagne. The Fine Line is the perfect place for boozy nights out with good food and wonderful drinks.

It is the coming together of conversations, encounters, and memories tied to this vibrant, magical land. The food here is not Indian as you know it, but Indian through another lens. Classics take on unexpected forms in the hands of Head Chef Thiru Gunasakaran, as they are reworked with a unique eye and modern approach.Fuelled by the memory and influences of the food that he is most familiar with - what he ate at home and growing up; and shaped by his Western culinary background, Chef Thiru's creations are authentically inauthentic. That is, rooted in history and tradition, but executed in a refreshing and playful way. What arrives on the plate gives rise to expectations that are immediately belied by the first mouthful - things are not what they seem but still, flavours are familiar and beckoning. To accompany these moments is a selection of explorative concoctions of Indian flavours and international spirits.Firangi Superstar is not so much a restaurant as an intense visceral adventure. Don't take our word for it. Come experience it yourself.

Open up his own restaurant, of course. Chef Alexandre Lozachmeur's Fleur De Sel is a quaint shophouse space outfitted with aged French furniture and a bar, whilst an open-concept kitchen provides tantalising glimpses into the culinary behind-the-scenes.
There aren't a lot of seats, a blessing when you're trying to have an intimate meal, so diners are guaranteed lavish amounts of attention in the form of carefully prepared, complex dishes, warm service, and much more. Find yourself enamoured by a la carte options and set menus filled with incredibly detailed French classics like Le Homard (poached Maine lobster, fork mashed ratte potatoes, chives, bisque jus, and basil oil), L'agneau (8 hour slow cooked Lamb rump with garlic, Green peas, organic carrots, and rosemary lamb sauce), and Les Saint-Jacques (pan seared scallops, mushrooms, arugula, Parma ham, and chicken jus). Distressed over what to order? You'd be more than welcome to partake in Chef Alexandre's degustation experience instead, where delightful seasonal ingredients do their best to blow you away.
Constantly evolving fine French fare, cosy elegance, lovely ambience, we could go on and on, but we thought we'd leave some of Fleur De Sel's impressive list of top qualities for you to discover on your own!

has been set up to nurture and forge a community for professional, distinguished
bartenders to curate innovative drinks for their guests. To kick-off this initiative, Ricky
has been invited to put his stamp on the second-floor bar and transport his regulars
and uninitiated on a whimsically spirited journey with his three-pillar craft cocktail
menu.
Manning the bar personally, Ricky will conjure up a combination of timeless classics
and carefully constructed progressive cocktail menu that will undergo seasonal changes
with the aim of pushing Singapore’s award-winning cocktail scene to greater heights. Describing his latest partnership, Ricky said, “I’ve known Anant for many years and
what he and Chef Jeremy are doing at JAG is phenomenal. When they shared their idea
of re-energizing their drinks program, it was an opportunity I just had to grasp. Flow
will be a very collaborative approach. We want JAG diners to feel welcome upstairs for
a pre and/or post-dinner drink and we want our guests to enjoy JAG as well. Our goal 
2
is to create a cohabitational space with a seamless dynamism for our guests across
both floors. While the cocktails and hosting are my territories, our bar-bites menu will be
an inspiration for my cocktail recipes and Chef Jeremy’s culinary genius. Each plate will
reflect my Californian vibe – fresh, light, seasonal with Jeremy’s signature French
refinement.” (Aug 2021)</p></li><li><h5>COCKTAILS WE LOVE</h5><p>Burnt Lemon Whisky Sour, Darke & Stormie, Jesse James, Peppered Pineapple</p></li><li><h5>href</h5><p>https://www.chope.co/singapore-restaurants/restaurant/flow-bar</p></li>","Flow Bar","https://www.chope.co/singapore-restaurants/restaurant/flow-bar",1

With his lovely assistants Jordi Noguera of Foodbar Dada lineage, and Dario Nocentini plucked from the Catalunya bar, Jubany conducts quite a show of Spanish culinary arts. The restaurant has just the fitting look, with zany motifs reminiscent of Picasso, materialized as if from a dreamscape. Pepper grinder light fixtures and super-sized sculptures of familiar faces float above the dining space. A vintage motorcycle adorns the walls, and the food too has a quirky appearance that eclipses the unexpectedly classic flavours. Jubany introduces Catalan folk cuisine, and with a wave of the wand, adds brilliant Asian twists.
The black Mediterranean paella is filling yet nuanced in taste, and the patatas bravas and tomato bread both show a different side of the traditional tapas dishes. On the more Asian end of the spectrum, the Thai razor clams are delightfully piquant, while the roasted duck with orange zest dumplings show the chef's hubris in remaking local favourites. The varied menu even includes gluten-free options like the chocolate hamburger, a dessert indicative of the humourous approach FOC takes to dining.
From the bar, brilliantly innovative cocktails are not in short supply. The menu is a clear demonstration of Nocentini's flexing of his creative muscles, using such unique ingredients as Matcha powder, cornflakes vodka, and galangal rum (though not all in the same drink).
If the name of the restaurant sounds like the slip of the tongue could be a dangerous one, it’s not an unintentional coincidence. Meaning fire in Catalan, FOC certainly plays with fire both in its name, its daring dishes, and its unapologetically unconventional approach to nouveau dining. (Sep 2014)</p></li><li><h5>THE BUZZ</h5><p>""FOC pushes out conceptual tapas dishes with a modern edge, including some Asian flavors.

Serving up a range of popular classics like Korean Fried Chicken, Bibimbap, and even Korean BBQ items, diners are sure to be spoiled for choice here, and if you weren’t a fan of Korean food before, you sure will be after a visit here!

Diners who enjoy the hotpot will be glad to know that there is a range of flavours available. The Pork Backbone soup base is popular with diners, and there is also a Chicken Ginseng option for diners who prefer something a little healthier. Seafood lovers can opt for the Grilled Saba fish, a sizeable whole fish grilled with a smoky and rich flavour. The meat is good on its own, but is best enjoyed with a bowl of freshly steamed rice.

The Kimchi Fried Rice is the perfect dish for diners who are going solo. Stir-fried rice with pickled cabbage, chicken, and various other vegetables, this dish is spicy, crunchy, and surprisingly healthy. Sipping on some Soju? There are some Korean bar bites that go perfectly with that! The Stir-Fried Octopus is a spicy, chewy dish that pairs well with the sweet coolness of soju. (Oct 2018)

Their best-selling version of yong tau foo involves deep frying the typical tofu and meat options till they turn deliciously golden, before you slurp it all down with a bowl of thick vermicelli noodles and signature braised mushroom gravy. Alternatively, the ingredients can be boiled but, if you’d like to have your calories and eat healthy too, stick to deep frying and add a portion of vegetables instead.Mid-afternoon is when the yong tau foo disappears but their Asian-inspired tapas won’t leave you missing it too much.

Serving an extensive menu, Fukusen prides themselves in ensuring only the freshest ingredients are used, with seafood specially airflown from Japan twice a week. The best part? Fukusen’s prices are wallet-friendly as well! Start your meal with one of their delicious appetisers — we recommend their silky smooth Pitan Tofu. For a more umami-licious starter, try their Spanish Carpaccio. Choose from a selection of fresh sashimi that’s generously garnished with ikura. One of the more unique selling points of Fukusen is their omakase style menu — offering omakase choices for their sashimi and donburis. If you’re looking for a quick lunch, the bento sets are a fan favourite and perfect for a lovely indulgent meal. We recommend trying the Omakase Donburi. As a side, go for their Foie Gras Mushroom Yaki, a deliciously light and creamy dish that complements any main. Along with their omakase-style menu, Fukusen operates as a full-fledged omakase concept by night, with prices starting as low as $100.

Occasional Asian elements punch up the flavours here, a selection of small plates and smoky grilled mains all blessed with the smoky perfume of an imported Josper charcoal grill. The mains are super meaty-heavy so lighten up with some green small plates to share. A refreshing and crunchy Endive & Shallot Créme-Blue Cheese Salad is a good way to start, filled with bittersweet endive, walnuts, and creamy studs of fruity blue cheese livened by an orange-balsamic vinaigrette. Or start the meat-fest early with creamy Bone Marrow, paired with refreshing white wine jelly, a piquant tomato salsa, and chips of deep fried garlic.
Once the mains come along, it’s a parade of beautiful grilled meats and seafood. Think chewy and sweet baby octopus given a rapid sear under the grill before being tossed with squid ink rice, a paprika-spiced rouille and sweet sun-dried tomato. Savour the rare treat of a Free-Range Yellow Chicken, roasted and deboned then served with olives, tahini, lentils, and a curry brown sauce for some exotic Middle-Eastern flair. Bone-In Beef Short Ribs accompanied by zingy beetroot and pickled potato will satisfy the meatiest cravings, but go slightly overboard with a Tomahawk, not of beef, but pork, a giant chop served with roasted pineapple that’s been infused with rum. A good, practically festive meal served in hip, Instagrammable surroundings, f<U+0233>r is one of the great gems of downtown dining. (Nov 2017)

Combine its exotic creative food with its relaxing location at the Sentosa Cove in Quayside Isle and you have the perfect spot for a quick Thai getaway without even leaving Singapore. Take a seat at the restaurant’s extensive outdoor dining area to enjoy the views of the luxurious villas and ease into the relaxing rhythm of the docked yachts bobbing along gently in the cove.
With a restaurant name that humbly means “eat rice” in Thai, you can expect simple home-style Thai comfort food such as Juicy Chicken in Green Curry Broth, sour and spicy Tom Yum Seafood Soup that is served with rice or rice crackers of course. Make sure you leave room for  Gin Khao Bistro’s modern and innovative interpretations of traditional Thai dishes. Pineapple is replaced with watermelon to produce a refreshing and sweet version of the fried rice dish in Khao Phat Dtaeng Moe. For the adventurous foodie, go for a spicy dessert experience with the Green Curry Gelato with Sticky Rice. Visit Gin Khao Bistro to give your mind and palate a Thai-flavoured break.

This is one of only three restaurants in Singapore that offers motsunabe, a richer version of the beloved Japanese hotpot made with miso and offal. Another key ingredient in their dishes is  beef intestines, which is incorporated into several of their small plate offerings, as well as several main dishes. The soft innards are cooked in a broth to bring out their flavour and collagen, and is said to be perfect for women looking to improve their complexion.

Seafood lovers won’t be missing out either since Motsunabe will be dishing out creations like the Stir-Fried Squid with Salted Fish. This dish is a briny combination of tender fish meat and firm squid tentacles stir fried in a savoury sauce. Perfect with steamed rice or even on its own, this is one dish that showcases the best of the treasures of the sea. The Hakata-Style Sesame Mackerel is another delicious dish featuring soft fish flesh bathed in thick, earthy sesame sauce.

With a fun environment, variety of dishes and a communal dining feel, this is the perfect place to unwind on weekends with family and friends without missing any of the action of the city. (Jun 2018)

Known for its porridge buffet, Goldleaf has also launched their first-ever a la carte buffet featuring eight of the restaurant’s signature dishes that diners can enjoy in unlimited servings. Start dinner with a chilled portion of the Double Beancurd Platter, where century egg (imported from Taiwan) is sprinkled with pork floss, bonito flakes and a touch of soy. The contrast of smooth, cold beancurd with the piping hot Taiwanese porridge is a great way to whet the appetite! The Omelette with Chye Poh (salted preserved radish) is reminiscent of grandma’s cooking, where the golden, fluffy egg is filled with bits of salty, crunchy radish. Good to share are dishes like Steamed Pork Patty with Salted Fish, and the Braised Pork Belly with Preserved Vegetables.

Seafood lovers are sure to appreciate the range of seafood dishes on offer here. The Oven-Baked Nonya Sambal Barramundi is a popular dish perfect for sharing. The tender flesh of the barramundi is flavoured with traditional Straits Chinese spices, giving it a fiery bite that is best enjoyed with a bowl of steamed rice. For something a little less fiery, the Sticky Shiok Sotong is a great option. Made with a generous portion of springy squid, tossed in a mix of chilli and sticky sauce, this dish is the perfect accompaniment to a bowl of soup, and can even be enjoyed on its own. 

Looking for a unique take on a classic Singaporean dish? Look no further than the cheeky Chilli Full of Crab Tofu.

Or go for their savoury and silky smooth French Onion Soup, topped with melted cheese and served with french bread. For a twist on your regular Wontons, try out their Duck Wonton Soup and bite into wontons filled with juicy tender meat that’s drenched with delicious broth. For starters, try out their Complicated Noodle, a deconstructed dish that gives you noodle sheets, fresh lettuce leaves, minced pork sauce, and chili sauce to wrap on your own. This fun dish is great for sharing and a fun way to ‘play’ with your food whilst waiting on the mains. Mains not to be missed are their signature Spaghetti with Thai Anchovy and Spaghetti Vongole. Their Spaghetti with Thai Anchovy is sweet, spicy, and oh-so-satisfying to slurp on, with the anchovies enhancing the flavor of the dish. Their Spaghetti Vongole is also topped with Italian anchovy, which brings out a delicious smoky flavour that complements the white wine sauce. For dessert, finish off with their Famous Thai Mango Sticky Rice to end on a sweet creamy note.

The three-storey lifestyle cafe and workshop space is housed in a charming, modernised shophouse. The cafe inhabits the first floor while the upper floors feature a lifestyle store and private space dedicated to workshops, corporate events and lifestyle classes. The interiors across all three floors feature granite floors, white-washed walls, soft lights and wooden furniture to create a serene haven away from the stresses of the city.

Coffee is a definite must and we just can’t have enough of the mouthwatering Western-Japanese fusion fare served up here. Varied, refreshing, and elevated, dishes here are executed with a touch of artistic flair that goes beyond your usual cafe grub. Take the Tamago Sando for instance, where fluffy Tamago-style eggs, paired with a konbu-infused mayo and pear sauce, are tucked snugly between toasted bread; or the Mondanyaki Beef Angus Slider, an intriguing cross between a burger and okonomiyaki that will have you coming back for more. For an instant pick-me-up on a rainy day, the Salmon Ochazuke does a perfect job; featuring a perfectly poached salmon slab atop some plump Kinmemai brown rice, salted plums, nori, and chopped shiso. A clear bacon dashi green tea stock comes on the side, to be poured across over the dish for a wholesome, healthy, and satisfying meal. Prefer something sweet instead? The Strawberry Wonderland, featuring a stack of fluffy pancakes and sprinkles of mint and basil will satisfy any sweet-toothed cravings.

Made for social dining sessions, these perfectly grilled dishes are served in smaller portions to allow diners to have a taste of the wide variety of menu options on offer!  Boasting a modern menu conceptualised by chef Andrea De Paola, and executed by head chef Federico Schiraldi, the dishes presented are prepared based on classic recipes with a modern contemporary twist dedicated to showcasing the unique culinary essence of the griliata. For the best dining experience, we recommend sharing a couple of appetisers before digging into a main from the open fire grill. The Rustic Bread is served with a tangy tomato sauce and extra virgin olive oil, a simple yet exquisite start to a meal!

This spot may be famed for its Assam Fish Curry - an aromatic dish that goes perfectly with rice - but there are plenty of other dishes that are just as noteworthy. The produce used is handpicked by Gu Ma daily, so diners can rest assured that they’re eating dishes made with the freshest ingredients. There are also some creative vegetable dishes, like the Crispy Bean Jal - which is made with thin strips of crispy deep-fried brinjal and French beans. The Stir-Fries Black Pepper Beef is another popular dish. Made with thin strips of meat stir-fried in a spicy sauce, this dish bursts with flavour with every bite.

While using top ingredients is not unique per se, Marco’s signature cooking style is: in his cuisine, the core ingredient becomes the main actor in the opera. Each dish has one ingredient at the center of the flavor experience. While the presentations are at times a contrast of colorful and complex textures, Marco’s dishes create a balance of supporting flavors, similar to how supporting artists dance in harmony, in the background of the leading act.
This philosophy is pushed to its boundaries at Guccio, with critics sometimes claiming that a blindfolded customer would always be able to recognize the chief ingredients in the dish she is eating. This style won chef Marco a Bib Gourmand from the prestigious Michelin Star Guide for
two years in a row, in 2016 and 2017.
Chef Marco welcomes you to his restaurant. Its décor is, once again, balanced and aims to be comfortable, while remaining in the background. At Guccio, customers will be at the center of the experience, with the colors and design elements to balance the surroundings. In the background of Marco’s main culinary signature style, Guccio will further differentiate itself by taking its diners onto a seasonal journey across the various regions of Italy, their fertile lands and their precious seas. At regular intervals, aligned with the four seasons of Europe, chef Marco will explore regional ingredients and recipes associated to each season, a unique opportunity to visit Italy even when 10,000 km away from it.
Marco’s creation will be paired by the best Italian wine labels available. As for the culinary ingredients, Guccio will not focus so much on education about new ingredients or unknown brands, but on outright enjoyment of the best that Italy has to offer.

It is a world of opulence, yet with a certain earnest simplicity and elegance. The Art Nouveau-inspired decor, with its highly stylised flowing, curvilinear designs of fauna and floral motifs, is stunning but not overwhelming, gorgeous without being showy. While the restaurant boasts furniture pieces from luxury brands, the overall sense one gets is of warmth and welcome.
This sense of elegant simplicity is evident in the menu as well. Gunther’s fans will undoubtedly be familiar with signature dishes like the Cold Angel Hair Pasta that has earned the restaurant accolade after accolade since its opening. The Oscietra caviar is delicately scented with truffle, which marries the flavours of the dish together perfectly. The delectably crispy Suckling Pig with Kriek Beer Sauce is yet another favourite. While the dish itself is evocative of wedding dinners, come prepared to be amazed by the range of savoury flavours that is packed into Gunther’s rendition. Other carefully thought-out creations such as the Carpaccio of Wagyu Beef “Tartare” style are also delightful. The meat is served with crispy potato – a beautiful contrast against the marbled Wagyu beef. Likewise, the Floating Island of Champignon de Paris on Consommé of Poultry is a magical concoction with the rich taste of egg yolk and mushrooms in every mouthful.
Apart from signature desserts like the delicious Fine Apple Tart “à la dragées” with Havana rum raisin ice cream or the warm soufflé with daily flavours, Gunther’s whimsical dessert creations are worth a try. Choose from 350 labels of wine to end your meal on a high -- it will be a suitably simple and elegant way to toast to an equally exquisite gastronomic experience.

He may describe his cooking as “simple, honest and down-to-earth"" but typical dishes include angel hair pasta with Oscietra caviar, roast rack of black pig, and a fine apple tart. Many regulars wait until they’ve seen the tray of the day’s special ingredients before ordering, however. The two dining rooms are enlivened by some colourful art.” -MICHELIN Guide Singapore 2016

And no, we’re not talking about ice cream here. The Gyu Bar brings in one of the rarest wagyu in town — Wa-OH beef from the Kumamoto prefecture on Kyushu Island. If you’re wondering why this matters, imagine this: the super fresh air and pure, pristine waters make the perfect environment for grazing cows. The meat here is also extra-tender, thanks to a special blend of feed given to the animals. At Gyu Bar, you’ll find some surprising cuts as well as the usual ribeye and sirloin fillets. Try the tomo-sankaku (a cut near the bottom round). A considerably rare cut, the glistening meat is juicy and buttery, served with a crusty sear. A little dab of wasabi helps balance out the fattiness of the meat. There’s also shin-tama, which comes from the knuckle, as well as leaner cuts like short plate. Besides beef, Gyu Bar also offers other meats like pork neck or tontoro.

Barbecue meats are not the only highlight of the menu here, though. Japanese appetisers and snacks are also available for diners who wish to dine on something a little lighter. The Choregi Salad is a mix of greens, cucumber, and mushrooms, and is a perfect accompaniment to the large menu of meat available. The Chicken Caesar Salad is also a must-try. Made with greens, spiced chicken, and cranberries and walnuts for an sweet crunch, this dish is refreshing and the perfect way to start your meal here.

The meat selection is one of the widest available islandwide. Along with the aforementioned Japanese Wagyu, there is also Wagyu Kurubi, Kurobuta Pork, and Pork Belly in a variety of seasonings, including miso for an authentic umami taste and chilli oil for an extra kick. There is also a wide seafood selection - with fresh king prawn, scallops and squid available for grilling. 

Still feeling peckish after your meal? Opt for some ramen - Gomanegi Ramen is a popular choice. Tonkotsu ramen with egg and cha shiu, this dish is perfect to wash down the meat-heavy dishes from the barbecue.

Head to Gyu-Kaku -- a family-friendly Japanese yakiniku chain that’s all about the BBQ experience, with good meats and vegetables to match. 

Prime Japanese wagyu is the star on the menu here, alongside other premium cuts of meats and an assortment of appetisers and crunchy salads. Start the meal with a light, refreshing dish of Cold Tofu with Banbanji sauce, a spicy sesame dressing that adds a hint of heat to the chilled beancurd. For meats, the Japanese Wagyu Chuck Karubi is a popular cut, particularly well-marbled and served in slices for simple grilling and enjoyment. There’s also the Japanese Wagyu Premium Loin Steak if you prefer grilling an entire slab of meat on your own, and getting it to the right doneness. 

Enjoy your meats bursting with bold flavour? Try the selection of Harami here, where slices of beef are pre-marinated in garlic, shio, or spicy miso for an extra punch. 

Besides beef, Gyu-Kaku also offers a good selection of Kurobuta pork, from the belly cuts to the collar, and the jowl. There’s also a wide variety of seafood, with favourites like the butter scallops and jumbo prawns.

Move on to the mains with a fragrant bowl of Mushroom Risotto. Absolutely delicious, this dish features perfectly diced portobello mushrooms and is finished off with a dash of truffle oil. The Roasted Chicken is another worthy contender that is served with a side of mash, sauteed greens in a rich pan sauce.

The menu seamlessly weaves in hints of Sichuan flavour into traditional European classics, so don’t expect the usual cafe fare here.

The Cured Sausage Shakshuka is a rich and unique dish that will surprise you with every bite. Spicy sausage chunks cooked with corn, tomato, and mushrooms, this dish is spicy, sweet, and flavourful. Dip the accompanying slices of beetroot toast into the stew for an added burst of flavour.

For something a little lighter, opt for the H&C Beef Caesar Salad, a delicious dish of tender braised beef tossed in a mix of greens and eggs. This dish is crisp and soft in equal measure, and for a salad, it’s pretty moreish. The fibre from the vegetables and the richness of the beef make this a good option even if you’re famished.

While this is a reference to the world-famous Ginger Garden of the Singapore Botanic Gardens where the restaurant is located, the word itself has long been synonymous with comfort for many -- ginger tea, ginger massages.

In the historic UNESCO World Heritage Site that is the Singapore Botanic Gardens, The Halia is an inviting space with lush foliage complemented by wood-carved tables and open verandas. This matches the menu well, as modern European cuisine with touches of Asian influences are on offer. Favourites include the Halia Chilli Crab Spaghettini and the Sticky Toffee Pudding with Butterscotch and Vanilla Ice Cream, so be sure to try them. The piquant flavours of the former ensure that you get a taste of one of Singapore’s most beloved dishes, while keeping your hands clean, and the latter is a throwback to a more decadent colonial past.
In keeping with the name, ginger is very much on the menu, with the irreplaceable underground root used in main courses, salads and drinks. The health benefits of ginger are multifold, from relieving digestive problems such as nausea to aiding the loss of appetite, motion sickness, and pain. It certainly is comforting to have all these great upsides in mind as you sip a ginger-infused cocktail, take in the luxuriant foliage, and relax in The Halia.

The best part? Quality and freshness is the name of the game here, with seafood flown in thrice weekly from Japan while their extensive menu is prepared using only the finest ingredients. Paired with an ambience that’s both modern and elegant, Hanashizuku brings you a peerless dining experience.
There are familiar eats such as Edamame but tickle your taste buds with their Octopus with Wasabi, Yamaimo Tanzaku (Japanese Yam) or the Buta Kimchi Nabe (Miso-flavoured & Kimchi Pork Clay Pot). We also definitely recommend going for their Carpaccio dishes like the Gyu Tataki Carpaccio (Sliced Row Beef with Garlic Ponzu Sauce). Classic choices such as the Salmon Ikura Don and Mentaiko Pasta are however just as delightful, a testament to the chef’s masterful skills.
If you’re looking for some drinks, stop by and choose from an impressive selection of premium alcohol from specially imported Sake to Shochu and Japanese beer. You don’t have to thank us for this hidden gem!

Well dream no more! Handlebar @ Gillman Barracks is here to fulfill your inner biker fantasies!
Opened by two fellow bike enthusiasts, Handlebar achieves the atmosphere of a rough-and-ready bikers’ den while serving unpretentious, mouthwatering international and local favourites. One of the favourites on the menu is undoubtedly the Cocaine Wings: smothered in smoky barbecue sauce, and coming in various levels of spiciness, these lip-smackingly delicious chicken wings are highly addictive. The Ayam Panggang dish is an instant mood-lifter. A large piece of chicken is marinated with a cornucopia of traditional spices such as candlenut, ginger, lemongrass, and lime, before being grilled till perfection and served with rice and accompanying vegetables. It’s also a treat to realise that Handlebar @ Gillman Barracks has the traditional Hainanese Pork Chop available on its menu. Popular with the older generation, this dish is making a comeback and it’s not hard to see why - a delicious delicacy, it’s crispy on the outside but stays soft and juicy on the inside. Handlebar @ Gillman Barracks is strong on atmosphere and food, so treat yourselves today!

Chinese seafood, in particular, with dishes that can be traced back to the Dongbei region of Northeast China. An underrated regional cuisine, it can be characterised by its use of pickled cabbage, potatoes, carrots, as well as wheat and corn instead of rice.The folks at this Chinese and seafood restaurant use fresh ingredients each time, offering an array of shellfish, fish, meat and vegetable dishes. Diners choose how they’d like their seafood to be prepared, and which sauce or broth to accompany — whether it’s 'hot & spicy', 13 spices, garlic or black pepper. Great for friends and families to share, the Seafood Platter is a mammoth creation, offering your favourite seafood staples in one set. The Baby Lobster is a juicy bite, while the Sea Bass in Soy Sauce tastes like something closer to home.Meat lovers can enjoy the spoils too, with Smoked Pork and Braised Pork Ear as some of the restaurant’s favourites.

For starters, dig into the restaurant’s signature slow roasted wings tossed in classic buffalo or barbeque sauce. Whipped up with carrots, celery, and blue cheese dressing, each mouthful of tender, juicy chicken packs a punch of flavours. For those who love their chips, the Classic Nachos will definitely satisfy your cravings. Layered with ranch style beans and a four cheese sauce blend, dip the crispy tortilla chips into the cheesy mess for a delicious time! 

Don’t leave without taking a bite out of the burger that started it all. Featuring applewood bacon, cheddar cheese, crispy onion ring, leaf lettuce and vine-ripened tomato, the Original Legendary Burger is set to wow you in both size and taste. The Impossible Burger is an equally tasty rendition of the legendary steak burgers which are vegan friendly. 100% plant based, the burger is served with fresh toasted buns and a generous side of fries for an indulgent meal.

The international franchise brings its brand of hard-pumping rock music, hearty food, strong booze, and top-notch entertainment everywhere it goes. This Singapore outpost, established in 1990, has the added advantage of being somewhat of an institution amongst late-night revelers at the lively Cuscaden area, a mix of interesting characters, a diverse mix of folks from die-hard rockers to curious tourists, all seeking the restaurant-bar's hearty food, hard-rocking local bands, and the raunchy humour of its resident standup comics.
The memorabilia is what keeps the Hard Rock family united across the world, but put that aside for a second and consider the grub. Think American dive bar with a little upmarket touch: chicken tenders in a smoky glaze of hickory barbecue sauce and honey mustard, buffalo-style wings in a piquant dry rub served with the customary blue cheese and celery, and the franchise's famous fajitas filled with your choice of grilled meat, tangy pico de gallo, and melty cheese. For something heftier, there's also grilled steaks and a selection of meats from the smokehouse, think massive pork ribs and beef brisket in a tangy, hickory-spiked barbecue sauce. Good food, good times, and good music have always been part of the Hard Rock promise, and at this grand old dame of the late-night Orchard scene, the party never stops. (Dec 2016)</p></li><li><h5>THE BUZZ</h5><p>""Decked out in music memorabilia, this spot is home to the popular bands Enigma and Acoustic Trip.

Laksa Popcorn Chicken, for instance, will win the hearts of all fried chicken fans. The crispy golden-brown nuggets of fried chicken are accompanied by a slightly spicy, piquant laksa mayonnaise that is so tasty, you might be forgiven for double-dipping.

This is why they have decided not to serve pork or alcohol so as to try to be inclusive to our local communities, including the Malay community from which they draw inspiration from.For a full experience, the tasting menus for lunch and dinner will give you a thoughtful and cohesive flavour journey through the crossroads of Asia. It starts with their signature chee cheong fun paired with razor clams submerged in a miso kombu broth reduced down with sablefish bones. The meal climaxes with their signature ah nya's fish curry made with a heirloom recipe comprising magical proportions of galangal, candlenuts, and turmeric. The coda of seri muka paired with apom berkuah ice cream and pengat sauce will surely leave you feeling satisfied and thinking about your next visit.The ala-carte menu allows for choice and contains signatures like their Octopus Bakar & Sambal Udang as well as brunch favorites like the Pengat Pisang French Toast. Don't miss out on their non-alcoholic drinks like their house fermented Lychee Ginger Ale and White Muscato Kombucha which are a progressive and delicious take on no-low alcoholic drinks.

The Haven’s Club is a signature sandwich and a must-try for first time visitors. Made with a slab of grilled chicken, tomato, lettuce, cheese, and egg, this dish is generously portioned and loaded with healthy ingredients, so it’s perfect even for guests who are watching their waistlines. The adorably named Crabby Wabby is another great option for when a sandwich won’t cut it. Made with perfectly al dente spaghetti and soft-shell crab, the flavours of the ingredients meld perfectly together. Craving something classic? The Piquant Fisc is right up your alley. Made with steamed rice and sambal fish, it’ll make you reminiscent of the simple times. The humble combination of fiery sambal and rice is an ode to the flavours of Singaporean cuisine.

The first of its kind in Singapore, the Japanese inspired, dual-concept offers a place for discerning guests to experience new level of hospitality and luxury. Located in Clarke Quay, Sushi Ichizuke and Here Kitty Kitty Vice Den will offer two distinct experiences highlighting the very best of Japanese cuisine and culture with an Omakase Sushi-ya and a cocktail driven bar concept. With travel off the cards for the foreseeable future, Zouk’s latest venture provides an element of escapism to the former glory days of Tokyo and the hospitality of the Oiran, a category of the high ranking courtesan in Japanese history. The sophisticated décor incorporates bold and creative elements, providing an immersive experience that boast an intimate and modern yet traditional feel. “During these uncertain times, we continually strive to provide our guests with refreshed and unique experiences, and look forward to providing an exceptional, one of a kind affair in Singapore with the launch of our latest concept,” said Andrew Li, CEO of Zouk Group. A throwback to the Golden Gai of the early 1900s 1950s, the ultra-luxurious nightlife experience at Here Kitty Kitty Vice Den is a contrast to its influence of the small alleys and interconnecting passageways of Shinjuku’s red-light district. The cocktail-driven space will houses three concept rooms, including the Cathouse, Mamasan Lounge and the Shibari Room, as well as a distinctive main bar lead by Head bartender Alistair Tan that offers guests a front-row seat to the action. With a menu featuring premium cocktails and a selection of Japanese inspired bites, the interior reflects a high-end Japanese experience, boasting different areas, each with a story and style to share.

Decked out in leather sofas and a towering wall of liquor, this eatery has successfully created an environment that feels more like a good friend’s hangout nook. This is especially true on nights where the live music is played or English football is televised on the large screens, drawing a buzzy crowd of people who are just one conversation away from becoming your new friends. 
 
Then tuck into the restaurant’s extensive menu which spans a collection of burgers, bar bites, grilled meats, pasta, and even Japanese bento boxes. Some of the well-loved dishes (and deservedly so!) include the Warm Seafood Salad where scallops, shrimp, squid, and crab meat are served alongside warm garlic bread. The Sausage Sampler is sure to become your next favourite thing, with an expansive variety of meats that include chicken mushroom sausage, pork chorizo, veal bratwurst, among others.  
 
Featuring an intoxicating blend of cold brews, good nosh, and a lively crowd, The Hideout at District 20 is one of our favourite Marymount-based hangouts that injects a dose of much-needed fun into the neighbourhood. (Jun 2018)

But over at The Hitsuji Club, it's all about lamb in varying cuts. This intimate 20-seater specialises in jingisukan, a popular Hokkaido dish where mutton is grilled over a skillet. The chef’s insistence to use only grain-fed, chilled baby lamb from Australia or New Zealand means you don’t get the gamey smell so often associated with this meat. Instead, the grilled lamb chops are juicy and tender, with a clean, milky taste. 

Try the specialty Jingisukan With Lamb Chop set, which comes with different cuts such as the fillet, loin, and chops. Grilled together with plump mushrooms and fresh vegetables for an added crunch, the set can be considered a delicious and satisfying meal on its own. If you’re still feeling a tad peckish, add on some cheese miso and lotus root chips for nibbles. (Mar 2019)

Basically, you order a crab done in one of their six styles, and have them with some carbs. The carbs are amazing though: think heavenly, lard-and-seafood kissed, wok-breath infused Hokkien Mee, a fine Bee Hoon steeped in a rich clam broth, or the HolyCrab Fried Rice stirred up with flecks of crab meat. But all this is only accessory to the real deal: massive crabs cooked in rich sauces. The signature item is the Holy Crab, an angelic vision featuring a Crab cooked in a rich crab broth, with lots of vermicelli to soak up the goodness. Then there’s the Orgasmic Crab, with a little sin injected by way of a salted egg & curry leaf gravy that is the perfect foil for sweet bouncy crabmeat. For something with more unusual twist, there’s the Balsamic Crab, with the meaty crustaceans bathed in a pungent, sweet, and acidic sauce made with balsamic vinegar, fresh herbs, and spices. Then there’s the house version of Singapore’s national dish: Singapore Chili Crab, and there are five levels of spiciness you can choose from, one for each decade of our independence. If you’re feeling a little crabbed out, throw in some decorative Seasonal Vegetables, or better yet, carb out some more with an order of fried Mantou buns to soak up all that sauce with. Don’t tell your cardiologist. (Jun 2017)

Recipients of ""Singapore's Favourite Food"" in 2013, and also voted the ""Best Pepper Crab in Singapore"", it's clear that diners love the restaurant's ability to serve that perfect pincer.
One taste of their famous signature Black Pepper Crab and you'll be in love too! Their use of a milder pepper gives just enough heat to allow the sweetness of the ocean-fresh Sri Lankan crab to really come through, and often means you'll be down two claws before you've even realised how much you've eaten!
These capable culinary captains of crustaceans are capable of more than just that though. At Home of Seafood, you have the option of having your crab steamed, buttered, chilled, cocktail-ed, claypot-ted, or spiced up with chilli. Our personal favourite of the lot? The Salted Egg Crab. Salty, sweet, savoury, and velvety smooth, their version of this increasingly popular dish has us wondering if the days of Chili Crab as the ambassador of Singaporean cuisine might indeed be limited.
So whether you vote chili, pepper, or salted egg, rest assured that you've got a home away from home nestled in the increasingly hip neighbourhood of Joo Chiat. (Oct 2015)</p></li><li><h5>THE BUZZ</h5><p>""The restaurant's speciality is Black Pepper Crab, and it is well worth whatever the seasonal price may be at the time. The black pepper sauce is not the vague, gritty stuff you get in so many other versions of this dish. This one has sauce specially created by their chef to be viscous, hot and amazingly smooth."" -SoShiok
""Home of Seafood's (crab bee hoon) manages to strike a great balance: its soup's fragrance and milkiness help to accentuate the natural sweetness of their Sri Lankan crabs without overwhelming it. Weighing a minimum of 1 kg each, their succulent crustaceans are also the sweetest we've tried."" -Epicure Magazine</p></li><li><h5>SAVE 24% WITH CHOPEDEALS</h5><p>Enjoy 24% off at Home of Seafood when you purchase vouchers from ChopeDeals.

Being located at City hall also offers much accessibility, a convenience that our original 28 Maxwell location once had.

The highlight of the menu would has to be the bespoke cocktails. Crafted with a local palate in mind, many of the drinks combine familiar flavours with exquisite liqueurs to create unique concoctions. The White Sands cocktail, for example, will have you longing for warm beach days. Served in a seashell and made with a heady mix of Kwai Feh lychee liqueur, Nigori Sake, and a coconut sorbet for some extra sweetness, this is the perfect pick-me-up drink for those sweltering days you’d rather be by the sea. Pace yourself with the alcohol by indulging in some bar bites, like the Hyogo Oysters. Reasonably priced and specially flown in from the Hyogo Prefecture in Japan, these plump little gems provide a briny flavour tempered by dashi to cleanse the palate and prepare it for more flavours.

An extension of a chi-chi furniture store, the interiors here are, needless to say, well-considered. Handsome wooden touches offset a gorgeous black-and-white theme, with quirky decorations adding some humour to the space. Add some coffee and gorgeous Belgian-inspired plates, and it feels like you’ve walked into the pages of Kinfolk. Whether it’s the baked goods at the counter, a fragrant Mariage Frères tea, or punchy Allpress Coffee, this is the hottest spot for a premium afternoon. There’s also heartier bites like open-faced sandwiches topped with farm-fresh produce: beautiful eggs, vegetables, and meats elegantly arrayed on artisanal bread and drizzled with light dressing. Tuck into Maria’s Moussaka, a cheesy, eggplant-based Belgian “lasagna” filled with minced beef and a light bechamel sauce, or the house Carbonnades, a ragout of beef cheek, yellow spud potatoes, tender baby carrots, and a malty Trappiste beer sauce. Chase all of that with an intense chocolate tart, some coffee, and a spot of furniture shopping, some of life’s great pleasures all rolled into one, perfect location.

Pan Fried Chicken Cutlet with Special Sauce, Steamed Marble Goby with Soya Sauce, and Sautéed Fresh Hokkaido Scallops with Broccoli are some of the a la carte options you can have, but save some stomach space for their signature crabs. There’re the ever popular options of chilli and black pepper, but for something a little richer, House of Seafood’s salted egg and creamy butter versions are deliciously sinful. What was once at Yio Chu Kang is now at Punggol and the lines are still as long as ever. Who says there aren’t any restaurants in the North worth traveling for?

Or the common concept that desserts are usually cold, sweet-tasting and “jelak” (sick of eating due to overwhelming sweetness)? At House on the Moon, we want to show that dessert is not necessarily the last course of a meal. We aspire to demonstrate that a multi-courses meal can be curated using ingredients and techniques often associated only with desserts. Our creations are not confined to notions of “sweet” or “savoury”, “warm” or “cold” dishes; but rather to engage the full palate of tastes and a sensorial dining experience. In the recent years, the blending and blurring of boundaries between sweet and savoury flavours has been increasing in popularity especially in the fine dining arena. The snack industry, in fact, has been leading this trend for some time now, introducing unique flavours of snacks like dessert-inspired potato chips and salted egg yolk ice-creams. Locally, the concept Is not foreign at all. Our beloved rojak, for example, blends fruits and sugar with spices and salted prawn paste. House On The Moon is helmed by owner-chef Hüseyin Turan. A German of Turkish descent, chef Hüseyin worked under culinary greats such as multi-Michelin starred chef Juan Amador, chef Paco Torreblanca (one of the world’s most innovative pastry master) and the traditionist chef Musa Dagdeviren. Over the years, chef Hüseyin learned and sharpened his culinary vision in Restaurant Bal D’onsera (Zaragosa, Spain), Café de Paris (Malaga, Spain), Restaurant Amador (Frankurt and Mannheim, Germany), Ciya Sofrasy (Instanbul, Turkey), Zuma (Istanbul, Turkey) and Zuma’s ROKA Oblix (London, UK). With chef Hüseyin’s culinary creativity, one cannot simply put a definitive label to his dishes; his desserts are not plainly desserts in the traditional sense, but neither are his mains considered savoury. The flavour profiles of his dishes just do not conform to the norm. Ingenuity or strange, one cannot deny the brilliance of his vision and immense talent. House On The Moon was initially launched as a dessert bar, but due to the pandemic which hit immediately after it opened in February 2020, chef Hüseyin introduced a collection of pastas and savoury dishes to respond to the exigence of the market. From the 7th January 2021, House On The Moon returns to the eponymous dessert dinning & bar vision to push the envelope of gastronomy and give diners a new perspective on desserts. The savoury a la carte menu will no longer be available; in its place are two “Haute.Dessert.Dining” sets – The Eclipse, comprising of 5 courses, and the Full Moon, comprising of 7 courses – featuring House On The Moon’s conceptual creations that promise to delight and surprise. Highlights of both the Eclipse and Full Moon menus include the Cauliflower Couscous, and the Spiced Semolina Dumpling, and the featured dessert by chef Hüseyin. The ingenuous Cauliflower Couscous dish elevates and venerates the humble cauliflower, first having the vegetable cleverly presented as a couscous, followed by a brilliant, jellified cream of cauliflower, with a dash of parsley oil and topped with tangerine sorbet and a sourdough cracker. Diners who want some protein with a more savoury touch may add S$9.00 for a scallop, which replaces the tangerine sorbet, and comes with a generous sprinkling of parsley sauce and tangerine gel for a hint of acidity and sweetness. Another culinary triumph is the hearty and flavourful Spiced Semolina Dumpling. Made with semolina and flavoured with ras-el hanout, a warm, earthy middle eastern mix of cinnamon, cumin, coriander, allspice, black pepper, and ginger. It is served with mango and passionfruit, with touches of coconut cream. Diners also has the option of adding beef cheeks to the dish, by topping up S$10.00, for a more savoury version of the dish. The meal is excellently finished with a Blue Moon dessert, exceptionally conceived by chef Hüseyin. The dish, comprising of carrots, sour cream, and coriander, forms a mildly sweet, slightly acidic dessert that is completely unexpected and redefines what a dessert should be. Regulars who have an impartiality towards House On The Moon’s signature desserts may opt to replace the Blue Moon dessert with a selection of iconic dishes from the dessert a la carte menu. “As diners become savvier to complex flavours and more receptive to the mixing of sweet and savoury, they are more adventurous towards crossover dishes like these,” says chef Hüseyin. “It will absolutely create a coup d’etat in the culinary scene but changes to dining perceptions are inevitable and inadvertent as consumers' taste buds evolve and cultures mix.” (Mar 2022)</p></li><li><h5>DISHES WE LOVE</h5><p>Scallop Chilli Crab Sauce, Truffle Takoyaki, Moon Walk, Kalea65, Black Forest</p></li><li><h5>href</h5><p>https://www.chope.co/singapore-restaurants/restaurant/house-on-the-moon</p></li>","House on the Moon","https://www.chope.co/singapore-restaurants/restaurant/house-on-the-moon",1

For starters, go for Oychestra for fat, juicy oysters topped with three different Thai dressings that will leave you hungry for more. Or go for the What The Fish Salad for a raw fish dish that’s equally tasty. Topped with fish roe, pork crackling, and a dressing of your choice, this dish is saucy, refreshing, and appetising. Offering a modest selection of mains, a must-try would be Hue’s original Not A Tom Yum Soup. A hot and spicy soup inspired from Southern Thailand, it’s filled with charred seafood and paired with an omelette. It’s perfect for a chilly day. This dish serves one to two people, so bring a friend down for extra stomach space to sample more dishes. Or go for their Pad Thai Remix, a delicious deconstructed pad thai that lets you mix all the best flavours to your liking. For the adventurous, try out Moocano, a sticky glutinous rice dish covered with chargrilled pork and lava sauce. The sticky glutinous rice pairs perfectly with the smoky flavours of the chargrilled sauce and savoury goodness of the salted egg sauce. For dessert, finish off with their Tea-ramisu which is this silky smooth, Thai-tea flavoured goodness.

From its vibrant atmosphere and the beautiful bridges, to the Dutch’s bicycle-oriented lifestyle, he knew that there wouldn’t be anything quite like Amsterdam. Upon returning to sunny Singapore, his love affair led him to start a cafe in 2013 that would be all things Dutch.

Now, the I am… Cafe is serves up amazing cafe grub to a bustling crowd everyday. And in case you were wondering, yes, the name is inspired by Amsterdam’s iconic ‘I amsterdam’ sign. Must-trys include the Dutch-inspired Fries & Mayo, featuring crispy thick-cut fries with a generous helping of rich mayonnaise. If you’re here with a group of friends, go for the I am... Platter, an elaborate showcase of all their starters such as the half-shell mussels, soft-shell crabs, buffalo wings, and many more. The perfectly battered Fish ‘N’ Chips has also garnered considerable fame, so be sure to try it while you’re here. You probably would have seen photos of their homemade cakes on your instagram feed, such as the cafe’s popular Rainbow Cake that’s as delicious as it is insta-worthy. The cake has seven layers, representing the rainbow’s seven colours of course. Top it all off with alcohol-free concoctions like the Virgin Lychee Mojito and the Bushramint, and your day’s made!

Priding itself on authentic fare, a smoky oven churns out pizzas to order, and these pies have attracted quite a following among in-the-know foodies in the neighbourhood. Choose from a comprehensive menu of practically every pizza flavour known to Man, from a piquant Puglia pie topped with anchovies, kalamata olives, artichokes, and mushrooms to the ubiquitous and controversial Hawaiian. If you’re a purist, stick to classic flavours like Cipolla e Pancetta, a red-sauce pie scattered with crispy pancetta, onions, and melty cheese. 

There’s also pasta dishes that will help fix any Italian craving. Think well-made authentic pasta plates here, none of that watered-down business you tend to find in Italian joints around the city. The Bucatini All’Amatriciana is a heavenly plate of tubular spaghetti tossed in a spicy, porky sauce of tomatoes, cured Guanciale (pork cheek), and tangy pecorino cheese. The Carbonara is a close cousin, made with a cheese and egg sauce instead of tomato, and prepared exactly as it is in Rome, with lashings of spicy rendered lard, black pepper, and no cream whatsoever. Grilled steaks and fish round out the menu, though honestly we think the hefty pizza and pasta plates will keep even the greediest of diners happy. (Jan 2018)

It’s easy to get overwhelmed when flipping through the numerous pages of this eatery’s menu. But rest assured that you’re guaranteed a great menu no matter which dish you decide to go with. Staples, such as Paneer Tikka made from cottage cheese cubes marinated in spices and roasted in the tandoor, are not to be missed. Fans of seafood would appreciate the evergreen Mahcli Tikka, featuring grilled dory fish brightened with a dash of lemon juice. The gold standard for any good Indian restaurant is in the vegetarian dishes, which are thankfully outstanding here. Dig into the creamy chickpea-based Chana Masala, cooked in a Punjabi-style sauce, or the Dal Makhani, where lentils are painstakingly simmered overnight in a mix of fragrant spices and herbs. Then wash your meal down with one of the four flavoured lassi drinks, the Rose Lassi being our go-to pick. 

Whether you’re in a hurry or want to slow down and savour a gut-busting meal, Indline consistently is our pick for a great meal that won’t cost too much money.

In an interior done up to look like a warm dining room - parquet floors, Peranakan antiques, and cosy lighting - orders are brought to your table with little fanfare, confident in their authentic flavours and contemporary touches.
Fundamental Nyonya techniques, classic recipes, and fresh spices, pounded together using the tried-and-true pestle and mortar method, result in fragrant traditional offerings like Kueh Pie Tee (crisp pastry cups filled with shredded turnip, served with prawns, crabmeat, and homemade chili dip), Ngoh Hiang (homemade five-spiced pork meat roll wrapped in soy bean curd skin and deep fried), and Organic Ayam Buah Keluak (braised organic chicken with black nut and exotic spices).
That's not to say that Indocafe is stuck in the past though; little tweaks to suit modern tastes are a constant feature in their menu. Feast on dishes such as the Otah Klasik (steamed 'Chawanmushi' egg custard with fish fillet, seasoned with coconut milk, and a special blend of herb and spices) and Chendol Panna Cotta, both great examples of when past and present collide.

It’s hard to resist starting the meal with bread, because the ones here are baked fresh in-house and speckled with delicious tomatoes or mushrooms. The Roman schiacciata, for instance, is a golden-brown flat bread with crispy edges, which you either enjoy plain or stuffed with earthy truffle. A must-order is the porchetta, rolled pork belly roasted until the skin is crackling with savoury juices and the meat is super tender. Pastas are the star for main courses — the baked lasagne, grandma style, is absolute comfort food. But the home-made tagliolini is a dish you’ll come back for, with the springy strands of pasta tossed with generous amounts of garlic, olive oil and chilli, and fresh, chopped prawns.

Based in the sleek and stylish COMO Dempsey compound,  Ippoh Tempura Bar serves a handful of small appetisers and tempura dishes guaranteed to astound and dazzle. The secret to these exquisite nibbles is in the restaurant’s use of fresh and premium ingredients, such as top-quality safflower oil. Furthermore, the chefs painstakingly fry each piece of tempura individually to ensure that the oil at the optimal temperature so that the tempura attains its crispy golden layer.

Start with some classic Baba Ganoush - smoky roast eggplants mixed with yogurt, garlic, and lemon juice. Mop up the decadent dish with some Turkish pita bread for a moreish dish. Be sure to save some space for the Lamb Shank though. Oven-roasted lamb cooked till tender enough to be cut with a fork,  served on a bed of fluffy rice. This dish is decadent and will leave you licking your lips and wanting more afterwards, so be sure to savour every bite. Vegetarians, fret not, as the Moussaka is another popular dish that is plant-based. Made with soft eggplants, zucchini, onions, pepper, and zucchini, this main is best served with rice or pita bread which is able to absorb its earthy flavours. 

For a sweet end to the meal, opt for some classic Baklava - flaky crunchy, and sweetened with syrup. Adventurous diners can opt for the Sutlac - Turkish rice pudding topped with cinnamon and baked. Served hot, this dish is a treat for both the eyes and the tongue. With a spicy-sweet flavour from the cinnamon and richness from the rice, this dish makes for a good winter dessert.

Known for their flair in perfecting smoky barbecued meat, you can choose from the many options that will wow your tastebuds with every bite. Enjoy the best of red meats with the Adana Kebap that’s made with minced beef and lamb grilled on a skewer. You can also bring a friend or two to enjoy their Mixed Kebap Platter that has little of everything for the ultimate indulgence. Balance all the meaty flavours with a deliciously cheesy Cheese Pide filled with creamy goodness and satisfying carbs. Appetisers are not to be missed either, and we highly recommend ordering a side of Hummus served with bread for a delicious mix of textures. Alternatively, get the Meze Platter, which comes with an assortment of Beyaz Pinir, Yaprak Sarma, Acili Ezme and more. Enjoy these light yet filling sides that are great to pair with any mains or grilled meat to enhance the flavours of the grill.To end off your meal on a sweet note, we recommend their Kunefe with Ice Cream, an indulgent, sweet pastry layered with cheese and clotted cream.

For appetizers, we recommend trying their Creamy Spiced Black Mussels and French Onion Soup. The mussels are basted and cooked in an organic coconut cream sauce and mixed with a special blend of spices, giving it an added layer of flavour. Perfect for sharing, this dish is ready to whet your appetite for more to come. For soups, they honor their french roots with the French Onion Soup, a portion of comfort food that is done right. Deliciously rich, soft caramelised onions with a layer of gooey cheese make this savoury soup the best dish for a chilly day, or for when you’re in the mood for something satiating. Serving your usual mains from burgers to pasta, make sure to try their Triple Infused Lamb Shank that combines soju, merlot, and spiced rum in a delicious concoction that perfectly tenderizes the seven-hour braised meat. For a lighter option, try the J Bistro Tofu Burger, which combines the distinct flavors of wasabi and caramelised onions in a burger that you won't soon forget. J Bistro also serves an extensive range of sides and tapas that goes amazing with their extensive wine pairings. Go for sides like their Tempura Calamari Rings for a crispy and light snack or their Skewered Yakitori Chicken that pairs perfectly with a glass of red wine. Serving air-flown oysters from different regions of France, enjoy the taste of the ocean with each morsel, freshly shucked upon order. They also have a Toscano Wine Pairing menu for diners wanting something different from their regular offerings. To end off your meal, go for their Traditional Baklava for a sweet and nutty finish.

Have a go at one of the tapas dishes – the Crispy Soft Shell Crab will prove highly addictive as you crunch on each tasty mouthful. The Steak Bites with Blue Cheese Sauce is another (rather decadent) option, where sirloin cubes are accompanied by fragrant helpings of blue cheese sauce for a mouthwatering, unforgettable dish. If you’re hankering for a hearty plate of pasta, you can’t go wrong with the Crab Meat Pasta, where angel hair is topped with chunks of flavourful crab meat, mixed bell peppers, and red onion – it might sound like a fairly basic combination, but it works.

Few meals are complete without a dessert to top everything off, so why not take a stab at the Molten Lava Cake with Ice Cream? Its nuanced, bittersweet taste will serve as the perfect denouement to your meal, and it’s a take on the popular dessert that’ll be as good as you’ve ever tasted.

Enjoy some top-notch Cantonese fare here, including chef-crafted dim sums, double-boiled soups, and Jiang-Nan Chun's signature Peking Duck roasted in a mesquite wood-fired oven and served with caviar. This traditional technique roasts the skin to a satisfying crisp while keeping the duck meat juicy and succulent; take a little dollop of caviar with the red meat to elevate the dish with a subtle sweet-salty aftertaste.
Gorgeous double-boiled soups such as the Hot & Sour Soup with Lobster or the signature Sea Whelk, Maka, Dried Scallops & Pork Ribs Soup are not to be missed either: wholesome ingredients are boiled for more than 15 hours to make soups that are rich, sweet, and highly nutritious. Other highlights include exquisite dim sum favourites such as the Steamed Scallop Dumpling with Crab Meat & Shrimp and the Baked Flaky Pastry with Smoked Ham, along with live seafood dishes such as the impeccably fresh Live Prawns and Dragon Tiger Garoupa.

The restaurant is surrounded amongst serene, lush greenery and a plethora of restaurants and bars, and offers all who dine there a resort-like ambience – the perfect antidote for all who are looking for a dining setting that enables them sit back, relax and enjoy their food al fresco style.
Furthermore, JUMBO Seafood (Dempsey Hill) has recently introduced their Executive Lunch Set - a fancy, fuss-free, non-messy way lunch option - which is only available at their outlet. This lunch set features a few of its signature dishes in single portions. One of the main highlights of this lunch set is the de-shelled crab claw drenched in a bowl of their iconic chili crab gravy served with fried buns. Guests who dine at JUMBO Seafood (Dempsey Hill) will also be able to enjoy the seasonal Chef's specials such as Cheese Baked ""Mentaiko"" King Prawns and Chilled Crystals of Ocean Sunfish with ginger Flower Dressing.
It is without a doubt that the JUMBO brand has evolved into a lifestyle dining brand that seeks to cater to the different taste palates and continues to deliver the authentic Singapore seafood experience in a slightly more luxurious setting. (Apr 2013)</p></li><li><h5>THE BUZZ</h5><p>

Dip the Charcoal-Grilled New Zealand Lamb Leg Satay in an accompanying crunchy peanut sauce. Zichar classics are must-haves for dinner and the kitchen fires up the wok to churn out elevated renditions of Kampot Black Pepper Beef, Sweet & Sour Iberico Pork ‘Goo Lou Yok’, as well as a hearty plate of smoke-kissed Hokkien Mee with Live Maine lobster.

Ka-Soh, an institution beloved for its comforting, flavourful fish noodle soup, is a firm favourite across all generations.Available in a few variations based on the choice of the various parts of the Snakehead Fish, Ka-Soh’s Signature Fish Noodle Soup is milky, tangy, and robust. The juicy white rice noodles, together with the fragrant fish broth and crunchy vegetables, make it an unforgettable combination. Other zi char favourites, such as Prawn Paste Chicken, are also available on the menu. Each piece of the chicken is marinated with a generous coating of prawn paste before being deep-fried to a rich, golden-brown colour. Eaten piping hot, this dish is highly addictive.  Another crowd-pleaser is the Fish Slices with Tossed Hor Fun and Bean Sprouts. Deceptively simple, the potent flavour of the dish comes from achieving the perfect balance between the saltiness of the fish against the crunchiness of the vegetables, as well as the softness of the hor fun noodles. Having been around for more than 40 years, and with an extensive array of traditional zi char dishes, plus its Signature Fish Noodle Soup, it is easy to see why Ka-Soh occupies a special place in every Singaporean foodie’s heart.

While the menu does serve a range of more modern items, the majority of the dishes feature traditional Cantonese flavours without introducing too many fancy tweaks. In fact, any change that executive chef and owner, Fung Chi Keung, makes is carefully chosen to enhance your dining experience.
Dishes manage to achieve full flavours without compromising the delicate tastes of ingredients, and presentations don't lack for fun or interest. The Garoupa in Lobster Soup will have your server bringing forth a whole garoupa - freshly sliced - to be cooked in an intensely orange lobster soup right at your table. The resulting broth is deep and chock full of tender fish. Their Peking Duck is a signature, understandably so given the deliciously crispy skin, and will be sliced and prepared at the table to be served with a selection of innovative wraps and sauces. Not to worry, their less exorbitant items are equally as amazing. Try their surprisingly succulent Sweet & Sour Pork on the Rocks which are served like colourful lollipops on a bed of ice.
With over 15 years and a previous position with Paradise Group, Chef Fung's expertise reaches from dim sum to excellent roasts, and Kai Garden is the perfect place to sample his creations.

""With these new recipes and presentations, you can truly sense (and taste) the excitement from Chef Fung's latest bout of inspiration. Kai Garden is a concept that marries tradition with the taking of risks, which, in our opinion, has paid off extremely well."" -Honeycombers

Derived from the word ""cosmos"" - a system of thought, Kausmo is the brainchild of co-founders Lisa Tang and Kuah Chew Shian.
The design of the 16-seater restaurant revolves around the concept of a ""blank canvas"", setting the stage for the transformation of aesthetically imperfect ingredients into delicious dishes. Every dish created at Kausmo incorporates thoughtfully sourced ingredients; seafood from small farming communities in the region, secondary cuts of meat which are often overlooked in favour of prime cuts, as well as forgotten native greens and florals. Combining European techniques with Asian influences, Lisa, who has worked at Pollen, Jaan, and Les Amis, demonstrates how lesser-loved ingredients are no less delicious than their popular counterparts.
Expect to be greeted with a sense of comfort too as parts of the menu draws inspiration from the team's cultural roots, such as Lisa's Teochew heritage. Each meal at Kausmo presents a thoughtful approach for guests to think about how they can all make more conscientious choices in their everyday lives and contribute to a more sustainable ecosystem, in Singapore and beyond. The restaurant even has a dedicated retail and feature space that showcases works by local businesses, artists and craftsmen with thoughtfulness as their focus.
Ultimately, Kausmo offers good food with a good cause, creating an authentic and warm space for conversations about thoughtful choices and conscientious living to happen around the dining table.

Situated atop the Customs House building with knockout views of MBS, it's no surprise to learn that Kinki has some celebrity backing. However, given the edgy, underground vibe of the place, it makes sense that the celebrity in question is a fictional sumo wrestler, who defies all odds to allow his culinary alter ego to shine. His story is etched all over the restaurant and bar, from the wild floor mural by an artist of ""Miami Ink"" TV fame, to the graffiti clad walls and comic book styled menu.

 

Despite the laidback persona of the place - with sneaker-wearing waitstaff and up-to-the-moment beats always pumping - the cuisine at Kinki Restaurant is nonetheless inventive, high-end and would make the restaurant's namesake proud. A palatable selection of mains includes the High Roller Wagyu Don - features ohmi A4 wagyu, Hokkaido uni, ikura, summer black truffle, onsen egg, Premium Unagi Claypot with homemade umami sauce and more. There's also traditional sushi and sashimi handled by masterful chefs behind the ice bar. ""Rock & Roll"" offers an interesting mix of creative maki rolls that lesser sushi restaurants are too risk-averse to try.

 

If there ever were a sushi bar bold enough to go for it, while still paying respects to the artistry of the cuisine, Kinki would be it. The Foie Gras and Scallop Nigiri features delicate, pan seared foie with a plump, juicy Hokkaido-bred scallop, while the Golden Age offers an expert balance of meaty fish and bright fruit. There are more filling mains and cleverly crafted cold dishes as well, a selection that is well suited for any range of hunger.

 

On the alfresco front, level three rooftop bar is a frequent hangout for the after-work crowd, with a plentiful selection of sake as well as the envelope-pushing cocktails you would expect from such a thrilling spot as Kinki. Long-standing favourites are the Kinki Mango Mint and Gin Berry. Their food menu also features an array of small bites such as Karaage Chicken Bao and Squid and chips.

A delectable buffet spread boasts authentic bites like Gado Gado Jakarta (a traditional mix of vegetables and peanut sauce) and Mee Soto Ayam (egg noodles in clear chicken broth topped with shredded chicken), as well as mains such as Rendang Daging Sumatra (richly spiced beef braised in thick coconut gravy) and Tahu Telur Surabaya (deep-fried beancurd and egg tossed with grated vegetables and spicy sauce).

Don't worry, that menu is equally packed with enticing delights like Udang Goreng Mentega (deep-fried buttered prawns tossed with egg yolk and curry leaves), Sate Lilit Bali (minced seafood skewered with lemongrass Balinese style), and Rojak Mangga Muda (Indonesian young mango salad) - all paired with fragrant rice, of course.

With a main focus in providing light and wholesome dishes, try a hefty selection of chilled and warm udon, as well as Nabe Mono, with udon in a hotpot — there’s also a kimchi edition! Besides seafood and meat, there are also options for vegetarians. For a light teaser of its many udon varieties, try the canape-like Kiyoshi Combination Udon, with three kinds of Japanese cold noodles: Ikura Salmon Udon, Tempura Udon, and Nebaneba Udon. Love Japanese curry rice? Try it with udon — the Pork Katsu Curry Udon is our top pick.

He’s changing the game by reinvigorating Singapore’s food culture through ‘imaginative’ cooking methods with a modern twist. Bringing Mod-Sin cuisine to a chic, sultry underground lounge in the heart of the city, The Kongsee exudes elegance through good food and good ambience.  Curating a delicate menu that highlights the best of Singapore cuisine, this fine dining industrial-style establishment creates dishes that pay homage to Singapore’s rich culture in elegance. Among the dishes to try here is their Otah. It's created in-house with a special blend and paste that brings out the freshness of the fish without any fishiness. For meatier options, go for their yakitori-style satay that makes the most of the iconic ’rempah’ smoke flavour to permeate the meat. Paired with a special house sauce that’s topped with chilli flakes, this juicy stick is highly addictive and tasty.  A great main dish to share, The Kongsee's Sambal Fish combines tender meat with a spicy, pungent kick - best eaten with a fragrant bowl of steamed rice. Other local flavours include their Singapore Laksa that's coconut-y and topped with fresh seafood. Served in a decent portion, you’re able to try out other different dishes without feeling bloated.  The bar also serves Singapore-centric cocktails, such as the creamy pandan cocktail that has an earthy fragrance combined with the boozy pleasure of alcohol to complement your meal.</p></li><li><h5>href</h5><p>https://www.chope.co/singapore-restaurants/restaurant/the-kongsee</p></li>","Kongsee, The","https://www.chope.co/singapore-restaurants/restaurant/the-kongsee",1

Another uniquely localicious dish is the Salted Egg Fish Skin. 

Smothered in the bar’s homemade salted egg sauce, the crispy fish skins are fried together with curry leaves, chilli padi and served up in true local fashion. Dangerously addictive, this mouthwatering rendition of fried fish skins will have you coming back for seconds. 

Still feeling peckish? Wrap up your meal with KPO’s signature dessert. A combination of the crispiest chips and the most decadent vanilla ice cream, the Chips N Cream is an ingenious mix sweet and salty you simply can’t resist.

Its dedication to exceptional food as well as its exclusive French wine list has earned it its spot in history – and a number of awards to go alongside. 

Reminiscent of the charming restaurants tucked away in quiet corners of Paris, the setting and décor of L’Angelus evoke a very warm and familiar feeling, emitting an incandescent love of everything French.

Casier à serviettes, wooden pigeonholes for patrons' napkins line the walls, vintage posters lend a dramatic feel and colourful cut-glass ceiling lets in warm tones of daylight and fill the room with colour!

The chefs follow traditional French cooking techniques, showcasing classic and interpreted dishes made from recipes honed to perfection through the centuries. The menu is expressed by dishes spectacularly simple and yet exquisite, devoted to using the highest quality ingredients, mostly air-flown directly from Rungis France.

The food is complemented by a unique and highly curated wine list, full of gems and vintages for wine aficionados. 

The bar is perhaps the best-kept secret of L’Angelus. Apart from an exhaustive wine selection from France, the bar offers a great selection of spirits, liqueurs, cocktails, and Armagnacs.

To experience the ‘true joie de vivre’ that comes with eating classic French cuisine, L’Angelus is the place to dine at. A reservation at L’Angelus is always a good idea! (Dec 2018)

The decor beyond its entrance is redolent of Paris – more specifically the relaxed bistro culture that’s so common to the French city – as diners sit shoulder to shoulder in a long, cosy stretch whilst wine and conversation flow freely.
The Plat du Jour is always their classic Steak Frites, slivers of succulent prime meat generously doused with a secret sauce that pairs perfectly with each melt-in-your-mouth bite. Accompanying those piping hot babies are a fresh green salad and a heaping pile of crispy, golden fries. Finished your first round and hungry for more? That’s when the servers offer you the second helping that’s been kept warm on burners.
Of course, other bistro options such as Leek and Vinaigrette and Oven-baked Beef Marrow with Rock Salt are on the menu, along with decadent desserts like the Vacherin du Bistrot (meringue, vanilla ice cream, and hot chocolate sauce) but really, there’s nothing like sitting in that buzzing atmosphere, especially in the dim lights at night, and enjoying slices of beef or delightfully savoury cheeses.

Located among a row of unassuming stores on a quiet street in the residential neighbourhood of Bukit Timah, La Braceria is an Italian eatery with food so authentic, it will transport you to the Mediterranean Coast.
Although not nearly as understated as its storefront, La Braceria's interior is still modestly decorated, with just a few pieces of artwork on the walls to spruce up the decor. The real focus at La Braceria is the food. The traditional menu includes a variety of antipasti, pastas, meats and pizzas from Naples. Although dishes like Insalata di Rucola, Spaghetti alle Vongole, and Ossobuco alla Milanese may seem standard, La Braceria's food is anything but ordinary, thanks to their fresh ingredients and superior preparation.
Be sure to look in the back for the walk-in wine cellar, where guests can peruse a large selection of wines. After a satisfying meal of high quality, authentic Italian food accompanied by a glass of fine wine, the trip out to La Braceria may seem more than worthwhile. (Oct 2011)</p></li><li><h5>THE BUZZ</h5><p>""For an authentic Italian experience at a reasonable price, we heartily recommend La Braceria. And judging by the crowd, this place is definitely one hot gastronomical property."" -SG Now
""Hearty, rustic Italian cooking is the draw at La Braceria. Wonderful, thin-crust pizzas with dense, flavourful toppings emerge from the blackened dome of the oven, but best of all are the home-made sausages – fat tubes stuffed with fresh meat, marinated for days in a secret blend of seasonings and spices."" -Time Out Singapore
""Despite its contemporary interior, the cuisine at La Braceria is the most rustic and sumptuous we’ve had in recent memory.

Chef Francesco bring the Romano Family culture to Singapore through his Grandmother recipes to the kitchen set up of the restaurant.

With the warm breeze rolling in from the Gulf of Naples into their rustic kitchen in Lettere, Gennaro Romano and his wife Anna worked diligently with partial skim milk to create the “Caseificio Romano” - a cheese house. This was in the heart of the 1925. The Mozzarella was traditionally made of buffalo milk, Gennaro introduced in his factory a combination of whole cow milk producing a “Fior di Latte”. This mozzarella was sold and distributed from its humble origins in Lettere throughout the Naples, spanning from the Salerno to the rocky cliffs of Roma.

<U+200B>In 1961, Caseificio Factory changed hands, passing to Gennaro’s son, Vittorio. He kept the original name of the factory and increased production. The family-run cheese factory became well known within Italy for its handmade authentic buffalo Mozzarella and Fior di Latte and up today Vittorio’s son Francesco, continues the tradition from the creation, to the production, to the sales of Caseificio hand-crafted cheeses and as corporate Chef of Italian restaurant chain in Italy and Dubai.

Chef Francesco’s passion and expertise are in each single dish of La Pizzeria at the Bridge & Beacon Bar, all made respecting the traditional recipe of his Grandmother and with the same passion, he trained all our resident Chef.

So come taste a piece of Italy right here in Singapore. These family recipes have been handed down for generations. Be our guest - you will feel right at home.

Sharing the grounds of Laguna National Golf Resort Club, home to two championship golf courses, Legends Bar offers the perfect space to chill out and cool down while taking in picturesque views of the lush surroundings. “Legends Bar is inspired by Dusit Thani Laguna Singapore’s unique location, with a history of hosting major champions such as Ernie Els and Sir Nick Faldo. We want to provide our guests with a comfortable and classy spot to enjoy drinks wittily concocted to honour golf luminaries from all around the world,” says Eric Piatti, General Manager of Dusit Thani Laguna Singapore. Guests can look forward to warm Thai hospitality and the infusion of exotic tropical ingredients, influenced by Dusit Thani’s roots in the Land of Smiles. A comprehensive list of wines, spirits, sake, and mocktails will also be available at the venue. Every corner of the warmly lit space is filled with rich green foliage, complementing undulating cushioned wooden booths and tables that offer cosy nooks for intimate conversations. The result is an intriguing and welcoming environment that evokes a sense of wonder and desire for exploration. Once restrictions lift, Nu-funk, house, and soft jazz music will play throughout, putting imbibers in a relaxed mood as they indulge in their drinks of choice. For a light-hearted touch to further enliven the atmosphere, Legends Bar also provides fun table games – think a micro-sized, compact miniature golf set, or Play Nine – a card game golfers and non-golfers alike are sure to appreciate.

The look of Les Bouchons defies any whim of trendiness and sticks to the standards of bistro design: curvy backed chairs and white tablecloths simply dressed with the essential fork, steak knife, burgundy napkin, and wine glass, sit upon tiled floors both inside and out on the charming patio. The shophouse locale fits the look, transporting the restaurant to a simpler time and slowed down pace in small town France. And with the upcoming selection of to-die-for steaks and free flow fries, you'll be glad to feel the minutes slipping by at their leisure.

Start with the Os A Moelle, or beef bone marrow served with crisp toasts. The meaty butter-like spread is indulgently delicious, and an ideal primer to the protein heavy meal. The mains are simply stated, and all come with sides of salad and endless frites. The Grilled Sirloin Steak with Herbs is a particular star as is ""The Real Entrecote"" from Normandy, which is best to be shared among pairs. The steaks are clearly of premium quality and cooked to rosy pink perfection with a caramelised char on the outside. The accompanying fries are of medium thickness with fluffed centers and crisped coatings, ideal for dipping into the classic sauces of mustards, bernaise, mayonnaise and horseradish.

However, the steak haven is no one-trick pony. On the weekends, the talented kitchen pulls out all the stops with the Couscous Royal, a tempting platter of marinated and grilled lamb, chicken and Merguez sausage upon a flavored bed of couscous. Or else try the Jumbo Prawn, kissed by the grill and drizzled with olive oil to bring out the natural sweetness of the crustacean. The dish is another reminder from Les Bouchons that French cooking needs only the very basics to be done well.

Or else try the Jumbo Prawn, kissed by the grill and drizzled with olive oil to bring out the natural sweetness of the crustacean. The dish is another reminder from Les Bouchons Rive Gauche that French cooking needs only the very basics to be done well.

The executive lunch set is a big hit with office workers, as is the dim sum menu, which features an array of delicate nibbles crafted with premium ingredients. We especially love the Crystal Skin Dumpling, a tender creation bursting with colourful vegetables. Meals here begin with the classic Chinese delicacy, Shark’s Cartilage Soup. Rich, tender fish maw and Goji Berries are the crowning glory of this light soup, that makes for the perfect precursor to the carefully curated cuisine that follows.

Since 2003, it has provided both members and non-members of the Singapore Maritime Officers’ Union with a place to socialise and unwind. If you want to enjoy fresh and tasty seafood in a good ambience, you won’t go wrong with Lighthouse Bistro.
If you’re in a big group, pay homage to the bistro’s past by having the Fishermen’s Board - a platter of tiger prawns, fresh blue mussels, crispy Atlantic dory, and garlicky, spicy batavia squid. Enjoy the Milk-Battered Calamari that is topped with copious amount of chicken floss and tangy lemon tartar sauce. For mains, the Fishermen’s Angel Hair is a great fusion noodle dish with a spicy sambal kick. If seafood is not your thing, fear not! Soaked in a special marinate for 24 hours, the Honey Charred Chicken emerges completely tender and succulent, definitely a crowd favourite for a reason. For a sweet finish, try Mary’s Butter Cake, which is a buttery vanilla cake topped with either chocolate or vanilla ice cream, cookie crumbles, and berries.
The team at Lighthouse Bistro is extremely dedicated and driven to create good memories for you. Since its founding, it has undergone three major revamps to provide a refreshing experience. By providing quality at affordable prices, it is of little wonder that many of the diners are repeat customers.

Set in a beautifully restored shop house, the ambiance prepares you for ""liming"", which is Caribbean lingo for chilling with friends. Given rave reviews for its authentic island cuisine - a rare find in Singapore - Lime House Caribbean is a mecca for those looking to indulge in good vibes, friendly gatherings and a Caribbean menu devised by their head chef from Barbados, Kirk Brathwaite. Having had extensive experience working at some of the most luxurious resorts in the Caribbean, he means serious business when it comes to churning out delicious fare.
 
Kirk puts his spin on classics but isn't afraid to introduce new and exciting dishes that evoke the Caribbean. Pepper Shrimp, Seafood Cakes, Calypso Fish, Blue Mountain Steak, Fire Roasted Stuffed Sweet Potato, and Tropics Cheesecake, it's an endless list of punchy flavours. With a “welcome home” philosophy at the core of the Lime House Caribbean Experience, diners are also free to make themselves comfortable by sharing hearty platters of Wings, Sliders, and an assortment of other trademark Caribbean bites that are sure to become favourites.
 
Renowned philosopher Captain Jack Sparrow once posed the existential question, ""But why is the rum gone""? Well, we're happy to confirm that it isn't, and that Lime House Caribbean has a plentiful stash that would make any pirate jealous!

Founded in the early 2000s in Inner Mongolia, this greenhorn shook up the hotpot scene in China with their innovative hotpot -- minus the dipping sauce. Their rich broth all but made up for the lack of condiments, and the recipe has stayed consistent for over eighteen years. What’s so special about the broth? The savoury soup base, made with seven special spices and mutton from Inner Mongolia, retains its signature flavour even after long hours of boiling. 

The Four Mushroom Soup is one of their most popular broths. Earthy and not too spicy, this base choice adds richness to all the items added. Meat-lovers are sure to enjoy the array of dishes on offer for the hotpot. The Australia Sirloin Beef Cubes are rich and buttery, and absorb the spices of the soup, enhancing the meat’s flavour with a spicy kick. One of their most raved options for hotpot is the Lamb Roll, which consists of paper-thin slices of lamb rolled into small tubes. The meat cooks quickly and is thin enough to soak up all the broth’s flavours. The lamb cuts are available on their own or as a combination with beef slices.

Our name is German for local, an influence that be explained by its proximity to Goethe-Institut Singapore and is also reflective of our diverse and worldly approach towards food that can be enjoyed by the people in Singapore. 
In the day, he serves up healthy and hearty brunches but slowly transits into a cozy and versatile space for intimate dinners & casual cocktails sessions with comfort food by German Head Chef Max Strauch. Aside from the normal menus, both Chef Darren & Max also prepare Daily Specials with fresh seasonal produces for Brunch & Dinner, like Victorian Truffles & White Asparagus.

Chef Darren Farr, more prominently known by his Instagram followers as ‘fuzzychef’, used to work at Tetsuya’s in Sydney, before working at various restaurants across London and Hong Kong.

Chef Max Strauch spent most of his childhood growing up in Jakarta (which explains how he can speak fluent Bahasa) before heading back to Germany to further his culinary journey, spending years in Cookies Cream, a popular vegetarian fine dining restaurant in Berlin. The well-travelled Chef Max also worked in Hamburg & Australia before settling into The Lokal in Singapore, showcasing his style of comfort food with great produce.

However, Lolla has proven itself to be the cream of the crop, as evidenced by the standard wait list for a reservation to sample their fare. Here's some insider intel: book for lunch, where you can request a seat at the coveted bar (which is saved for those few well-timed walk-ins come dusk) and avoid the feeding frenzy of dinner time service. Why is the zinc-plated bar the place to be? From here, you can watch the compact kitchen create the wondrous small plates that have earned Lolla international acclaim.Such plates include the Sea Urchin Pudding, a deceivingly miniature vessel of deadly-rich egg yolk custard, blackened by squid ink and topped with tangerine-coloured morsels of urchin plucked straight from the ocean. The dish is at once thick and light, the depths of umami refreshed by a spritz of the sea. The Beef Tongue and Cheek are similarly brilliant, tenderized to banish any minerally gristle and which presents a unique meaty flavour spiked by pickled sides. All dishes benefit from a glass of bubbly, which is intentionally the bar's specialty. It's a fitting choice since the extraordinary dining experience at Lolla isn't exactly a steal, making it ideal for special occasions.In the basement, a large, democratic table-for-all accommodates the majority of diners, a design choice that loosens up the mood. The concrete and bare bulb ascetic is softened by vintage touches like antique crystal vases posted alongside family-sized cans of artisan ingredients atop the bar. The menus are simply stated and printed with Victorian comics on paper placemats. The décor, along with the exceptional culinary musings served, ensure that Lolla really lives up to the hype.

Perfectly complemented with a steaming bowl of rice or alone, this dish combines their signature spices that tenderize the meat. Veggie lovers are in for a treat here with delicious options that will have you going back for more. The Spinach with Fish Curd in Superior Stock is a favourite here. It's perfect for sharing. The fish curd melts in your mouth, while the spinach provides a nice crunch. For a less soupy option, go for their Triple Dou Miao with savoury pork bits and crunchy leaves. It’s a great dish to pair with their London Peking Duck. You should also check out their Poached Chicken with Garlic and Spring Onion Sauce. This dish is delicate and tender, with plump meat that mixes perfectly with the garlicky and savoury sauce. Best paired with a fragrant bowl of steamed rice, try their Poached Rice in Prawn Broth to go with for a change, and enjoy the natural sweetness of the prawns with the delicious taste of their Poached Chicken. London Fat Duck also serves a modest dim sum menu with unique offerings. Enjoy their Crispy London Duck Snow Buns, which are light and filled with sweet and savoury glazed meat.

It has become a household brand in Singapore that's loved and of course, a must try. Their must-try dish is of course the Signature London Roast Duck, made with a delicious blend of spices that coats the duck perfectly. Each slice of duck is tender, juicy and savoury, making this dish an amazing addition to your meal. For diners looking for a different kind of protein, London Fat Duck also offers their Barbeque Pork with Honey Sauce “Char Siew” and Hong Kong Crackling Pork Belly “Siew Bak”. Their Char Siew is melt-in-your-mouth tender and basted in a sweet honey sauce that makes the meat addictive and savoury sweet. Their Crackling Pork Belly is oh so satisfyingly juicy and the meat is tender yet firm. For the full experience, we recommend diners to try all three meats to fully appreciate and enjoy their expertise in the meat roasting department. Looking to impress your guests? Their London Peking Duck is a definite showstopper with glazed crispy skin and deliciously juicy meat. A perfect ‘DIY’ wrap, this dish is fun and loved by young and old for its presentation and taste, making this a must-have dish at the table. If you’re more for a noodle-based option, London Fat Duck also offers delicious noodles that are equally satiating. Go for their Ramen in Superior Stock with Prawn Pasta for an umami meal that’s heavy on the flavour profile yet comes in a light broth that will have you slurping every last drop up. For something more carb heavy, London Fat Duck’s XO Duck Bakkwa Fried Rice is a must-try. So unique and tasty, you won’t be able to stop at a bite with this dish.

Decorated with plush armchairs and wood accents, the bar gives off prohibition-era vibes, and is the perfect place for a post-work drink.

The artisanal cocktails here are a must-try. The Angelique is notable for its light flavour accented by the addition of Chita Suntory Whisky.

Feeling peckish? The kitchen serves up some traditional French bites that pair perfectly with the drinks. Try the delectable Croque Monsieur. Made with gooey melted cheese and rich ham sandwiched between two slices of soft bread, this is the perfect option for diners looking for something substantial. The Croque Salmon offers a similar option made with salmon instead of ham. The flavour of the fish pairs well with the other ingredients for a unique taste. (March 2019)

Head here with friends after work for some tipples to welcome the weekend at the bar, or romance a date in the elegant ambience of the restaurant - whatever the occasion, this spot has got you covered.
With esteemed chef Takashi Okuno helming the kitchen, diners can expect a riot of flavours from the dishes here. Fresh ingredients, innovative cooking techniques, and an unorthodox take on classic Italian cuisine make for a menu bursting with dishes you wouldn’t find at a typical Trattoria. When in doubt, you can’t go wrong with something that is housemade.Start with the Housemade Wagyu Bresaola- an air-dried cured beef bursting with flavour. The meat has more intense flavours due to the dry ageing process, and as a result, this dish is perfect paired with a glass of red wine from the bar.

Opened by acclaimed restaurateur Alan Yau, Madame Fan represents a shift from the in-your-face luxury of traditional Chinese dining to a more subtle opulence. This is reflected in the menu, which focuses on premium ingredients cooked to bring out their best flavours. 

The Wok-Fried Crispy Duck is a must-try. Made with tender duck meat fried to perfection, this dish is crisp on the outside, tender on the inside, and goes perfectly with a bowl of steamed rice. Another signature plate at this restaurant would be The White Pepper Crab, a less searing version of one of Singapore’s most iconic fare. This seafood delight preserves the airy egg white sauce but uses white pepper for a more delicate flavour. 

Diners who love their carbs can indulge in the Claypot Japanese Rice With Japanese Sweet Potato. The claypot cooking enhances the taste of the dish and its accompanying items, giving the rice a heartier taste, while the Japanese sweet potato provides some delicate sweetness, balancing out the flavours. The Lobster Cantonese with Wanton Noodle is another great option as the lobster meat is lightly sweet and juicy, and pairs perfectly with the tender noodles. (June 2019)

Service here is warm, friendly, and personal. Helmed by the affable Jacylyn, service is as much part of the nostalgic charm of the restaurant as the timeless dishes they have on offer. Their outdoor tables have a casual elegance that look (and feel) incredibly comfortable, and during the drier months of Singapore's skies, are an excellent place to have a long, wine-enriched dinner with friends.
On the new menu, the Appetizers section is headlined with Michelangelo's famed Calamari Fritti. The light crunchy morsels come with two dipping sauces, and it's no wonder they come highly recommended by regulars and staff alike. The menu now offers two pasta sections: Pasta Classico which offers a range of Singapore’s favourite pasta selections, and Pasta Speciali where all your Michelangelo's signatures return to delight you once more. There are, of course, non-pasta options like the Seafood Cartoccio, which is a sublime medley of seafood cooked in a white wine and tomato broth wrapped in a paper package.
It's a varied and delicious sounding menu, and since we’re sure that Michelangelo's will still be winning fans for many years to come, you’ve got all the time you need to try every single option that tickles your fancy. (Sep 2012)</p></li><li><h5>THE BUZZ</h5><p>""Taking over the space that was formerly occupied by Michelangelo's is this new Italian concept with more homey dishes on the menu. The vibe and decor is kept pretty similar with a dark color scheme and plush booth seats accented with red.

A massive wine room calls invitingly as you sit down to order, so you may as well crack open a bottle and make an event of the visit.
The superb plates certainly demand some vino as accompaniment: think starters of bouncy Hokkaido Scallops, or Australian beef carpaccio done up with lashings of black truffle and sesame dressing. For an extra classic touch, spread some croutes with a smearing of Foie Gras Terrine, perfect with a semi-dry white wine as you wait for your mains. The more classic fare on the plats principaux, from Argentinian Beef Tenderloin given the simple salt and jus treatment, to an elegant risotto of asparagus and seared Boston lobster, sweet, buttery, and indulgent. Dessert is a refined affair of peaches poached in fragrant amaretto, followed by a platter of French cheeses to elongate the meal alongside the good conversation and more wine. The French do it right, and this is an invitation to indulge and turn a simple meal into a luxurious event.

But while Majestic Bay Seafood does a wonderful rendition of both, what you should really be there for is Chef Yong Bing Ngen's award-winning, signature creation: the Kopi Crab. This dish is a reflection of Chef Yong's culinary philosophy that Chinese cooking is a great canvas for bold, artistic flourishes. Tossed with a sauce made from fruit jams and juices, and three varieties of coffee beans, the crab's flavours blend harmoniously, leaving you savouring every last morsel! Flambéed tableside, it's one of those dishes that you never knew was missing from your foodie bucket list until you've tried it.
If you're fishing around Gardens by the Bay for a light bite, Majestic Bay Seafood also fits the bill. Its tantalising dim sum, only available for lunch, is worth a visit on its own. Pick from local favourites like Steamed Custard Buns with Salted Egg Yolk, oozing with creamy goodness, or signatures like their Seared Chilli Crab Meat Buns.
Dining at Majestic Bay Seafood is as much a feast for the eyes as it is for our bellies. Indeed, if it weren't for the restaurant's impressive waterfront view of Marina Bay, and magnificent display of 3D textured artworks by Singapore-based artist Hong Zhu An, we'd be sorely tempted to pack a basket of that dim sum for a picnic among the lush greenery!

Opened in Kampong Bahru by Hokkaido-born Urayama Satoru, this restaurant serves up a range of fresh fish grilled to perfection, as well as a variety of seafood dishes. Due to their late opening hours, this restaurant is a favourite of late-night stragglers and Japanese chefs alike.

The Mixed Sashimi Rice Bowl is a must-try here. Featuring a decadent slices of fresh tuna and salmon layered over a bed of rice and topped with greens, this dish is the perfect pick-me-up for a midday meal. The buttery velvet fresh fish slices contrast well with the crunch of the vegetables, and the soft rice soaks up the umami flavour of the fish. Diners chasing a spicy kick can opt for the Spicy Garlic Ramen - a dish consisting of springy noodles and egg bathed in a red hot broth - with three levels of spice to choose from, you can customise your dish to suit your specific needs.

The Stir Fry with Squid Ink is the perfect dish for seafood lovers. Made with saline squid ink, this dish is made with firm squid tentacles and flavoured with chilli. The dish is topped with crunchy greens that add to the bite of the meat. (Jun 2018)

Margarita’s Dempsey Hill is one such culinary gem, sporting a rich history that dates all the way back to 1988, with a longevity can be credited to its authentic and succulent Mexican bites that don’t cost a pretty penny. 
 
Explore a trove of Mexican grub with bright and fiery appetisers such as the Cheese Fondue that gets its kick from a dash of chiles and chorizos. Meanwhile, the Nachos La Especial is another evergreen favourite, made with a seasoned blend of black beans, chipotle cheese sauce, jalapenos, guacamole, sour cream, and pico de gallo. 
 
And we can’t talk about the mains without salivating. There’s the drool-worthy Carnitas de Puerco, which features a fork-tender piece of pork slowly roasted in the oven and served with a zesty dollop of salsa verde on warm corn tortillas. And be sure to save room for the tantalising desserts which include the popular Mexican Fried Ice Cream or warm Churros. 
 
Good Mexican cuisine made from fresh ingredients. That’s the concept behind Margarita's Dempsey Hill and we can’t ask for anything more. (Apr 2018)

Dashi Master Marusaya takes great pride is offering a large selection of healthy, Dashi-based dishes. For the non-epicureans among us, natural Dashi (as opposed to chemically-composed additives) is a key seasoning developed from Katsuboshi (dried bonito) and ingredient in Japanese cooking.

As a result, the stars of the menu are those dishes which make full use of the umami taste of the natural Dashi. For example, the Dashi Katsu Toji (Pork Cutlet with Dashi Sauce) are deep-fried pork cutlets from Hokkaido which go perfectly with the thick, flavourful egg Dashi gravy, whilst the Japanese Wagyu Beef Dashi Shabu features melt-in-your-mouth slices of beef cooked in a delicately-flavoured Dashi pot. (Dec 2019)</p></li><li><h5>THE BUZZ</h5><p>“Owner Eiji Futagami, a katsuobushi (dried bonito flakes) supplier, was inspired to open this restaurant to showcase the versatility of dashi – a Japanese stock enriched with dried fish and seaweed.” –Time Out Singapore
“The MSG-free soup stock features in a range of dishes: udon (from $13), oden ($15), ohitashi ($9)—cold vegetable appetizer—and, most notable, their shabu shabu (from $40).

Known for its abundance of green onions and signature negi onion oil, these bowls of tangy noodles are both a feast for the eyes and stomach!

Watch in awe as the expert chefs pour the negi onion oil over the steaming hot bowls of ramen to create a tall, dramatic fire. Featuring huge flames and a rich, flavourful broth, don’t leave without trying the restaurant’s signature Shoyu Fire Ramen. Created by simmering chicken bones for hours on end, this delicious bowl of flavours is topped with bonito and mackerel flakes for that umami flavour.

For spice lovers, we highly recommend the Kara Miso Fire Ramen. Born out of the locals' love for spicy delights, the spicy fermented bean paste packs a punch. The perfect balance of fiery and savoury, this Singapore-exclusive dish is a must-try. Besides ramen, there’s also a range of delectable sides that make great accompaniments. We recommend the Charcoal Karaage. Dip these crispy morsels in the citrusy wasabi sauce for extra zing.

With attention to detail, beautiful plating, and a curation of the best Japanese ingredients, Misaki Japanese Restaurant is great for an indulgent solo lunch at the counter, or an intimate catch-up with work mates.

For something comforting, the smooth Chawanmushi is given a luxe edge with the addition of uni, balancing the light tofu pudding with the saltiness of the sea.

Awash with the constant murmurs of lapping waters, this soothing quayside gem boasts lengthy pages of breakfast options to keep both adults and children satisfied. Plates like Mediterranean, a dish packed with delights like Halloumi cheese, freshly baked pita, and grilled sausage, Mushroom Frittata, and the classic Shakshouka, sit alongside sweeter options like Vanilla French Toast and Pancakes, and it’s a picky person that won’t find something to suit their fancy at Miska.
The rest of the immense offerings are both staggering and delicious. You’ll be tempted to fill up on appetising starters and a Greek salad, at first, but as your eyes travel on (and on), the lure of mouthwatering mains like Döner Kebab & Rice and a Kalymali Pizza topped with minced beef in spicy tomato sauce, coriander, and cheese, becomes more difficult to resist. Health buffs will also appreciate the lighter bites and preservative-free pita and wrap breads that showcase fresh products and homemade sauces to their best advantage. It can be a tad tough to find a spot that offers great food, family friendly atmosphere, and a chance to regroup from the chaos of everyday life but Miska Café has hit three for three in our books!

Under the deft hands of Fukuoka-native Chef Mitsuyasu Tatsuro, simple sushi ingredients are made to shine. The chef employs a “one fish, three ways” approach to his food, so diners can choose one fish from the daily menu and have it cooked three different ways. One notable standout is the Alaskan King Crab, cooked in styles that run the gamut from kaminabe, tempura, and sashimi to grilled & served with vinegar, simmered, or in chawanmushi. Other must-try menu items include the Soft-shell Crab Roll paired with a mildly spicy mayo. The Asari Clam Soup is another divine dish that doubles up as a refreshing palate cleanser. Then complement the fresh seafood offerings with any of the eatery’s numerous sake and shochu options, such as the Nama Sake, an unfiltered and unpasteurised sake that goes down smoothly with sushi.
There’s nothing quite like an omakase meal, a chef-curated meal where all you have to do is sit back and enjoy the journey. And if there’s any restaurant that ranks among the best, it’s Mitsu Sushi Bar. (Jan 2018)

During lunch, the menu is casual, offering a variety of sets that come with appetisers, soup, a main dish, and dessert. The Bara Chirashi set is a favourite among sashimi fans.

Perfect for intimate meals, the restaurant is segregated into private rooms with the option of dining at the sushi counter or the tempura counter. For the tempura experience, start with a simple plate of spinach and beancurd skin in dashi sauce before moving onto the scallop. Cooked medium rare, the wonderful texture of the scallop elevates the dish, giving it a fantastic flavour. Deep fried to perfection, the anago is a delicious mouthful of sweet and tangy flavour, enhanced by the acidity brought about by a drop of lemon juice. Wrap up your meal with a small bowl of fluffy Japanese short grain rice topped with diced tempura prawns.

More than twenty years on, she still maintains that unrivaled jovial atmosphere intrinsic to any classic Irish Pub.

Molly Malone's Irish Pub was actually born in Ireland and transported piece by piece to Singapore, where she was reconstructed in 1995 on the corner of Circular Road and Canton Street. There she remained for just over 9 years, before packing up house and moving across the street to the helm of Circular Road on Christmas Eve of 2004.

When you come for a pint of beer or our famous Fish n' Chips, you'll feel that you're in a home away from home. With all the live sport you could want, Molly's is always lively, full of interesting people, and (of course!) the craic! There's a true blue (or perhaps green?) sense of community at Molly's that you'll be hard-pressed to find anywhere else! (Jun 2021)</p></li><li><h5>DISHES WE LOVE</h5><p>Molly's Famous Fish & Chips, Bangers & Mash, Molly's Burger, Ribeye Steak</p></li><li><h5>SAVE 15% WITH CHOPEDEALS</h5><p>Enjoy 15% off at Molly Malone’s Irish Pub when you purchase vouchers from ChopeDeals.

As you walk along this iconic river, you can't help but sense an instant lightness in your step, a bounce in your walk, and a rumble in your belly. And if you think there's something reminiscent of the canals of Venice, why not answer that rumble with a trip to Mondo Mio?
Mondo Mio is an authentic Southern Italian restaurant which is as Italian as it gets. Freshly-made pizza and pasta make up the bulk of the menu and cheese is used generously. Still not enough cheese? The Four Cheese Pizza comes highly recommended. Fans of the thin thin-crust variety of the famous Italian pie will also enjoy the satisfying biscuit-like crunch with each bite.
If you're not a huge fan of either pizza or pasta, or just happen to be craving for a good chunk of meat, the premium veal shank is your answer. Braised on low fire with rosemary and thyme, the shank comes served on a bed of rich and flavourful saffron risotto made with simmered Italian Arborio rice. Just the sight of it is guaranteed to make you want to belt out a melody like a Gondola singer.

The interior of this restaurant is almost as green as its exterior, with hanging plants, repurposed wooden furniture, and wood panelling reminiscent of a weatherboard cottage.

This restaurant has won many accolades throughout the years and has gained an experience for their excellent food, and it’s not difficult to see why. Chef-Owner Petrina Loh draws on her childhood for inspiration for her dishes, and has created sharing platters of fusion cuisine that feature the perfect balance of flavours. 

Diners looking for a unique dish can try the Pork Jowl Char Siew Wonton Mee. Made with tender, locally sourced pork jowl, herbal soy sauce, pork and kimchi wontons, and a fiery jalapeño chilli sauce, this dish seamlessly incorporates the spice of Korean and Latin American cuisine into a dish that is uniquely Singaporean. 

Looking for a unique treat to end your meal? Look no further than the Jackfruit Banana Cake. Made with chunks of fragrant jackfruit and sweet banana, and topped with Mugi miso meringue and drizzled with chocolate sauce, this dish is deliciously sweet without being cloying, and the perfect dessert to end an excellent meal. 

Ultimately, while Chef Petrina's culinary pedigree is nothing to sniff at, with Le Cordon Bleu and a stint at HUSK in Nashville under her belt, it's really the intimate hospitality and innovative courses that will keep you coming back, time and time again, for more.

Not skimping on any detail, everything from the succulent steaks and fresh seafood to the vast wine collection and seamless service reiterate the classic and exceptional dining experience Morton's is widely known for.
As mentioned, no detail is overlooked and this is clearest when glancing at the menu. Serving the best available aged grain-fed beef, such as the must-try 48-ounce (1300g) Porterhouse and 20-ounce (550g) New York Sirloin, as well as fresh fish, Maine Lobster,  and lamb chops - the menu offers generous portions of it all.
Equally renowned for their extensive wine list, the bar at Morton's is one of our favourite post-work spots to grab a drink, indulge in bar bites like their Blue Cheese Steak Fries, and loosen up after a long day at work!

There is still a strong focus on authentic, home-cooked style dishes, and the new revamped menu combines old favourites with new ones. Simple, classic favourites like the Pulpo de la Casa (grilled fresh octopus seasoned with pimenton, sea salt, and olive oil) or the Chuletillas de Cordero ($32), pan-fried cutlets of milk-fed lamb with a garlic white wine reduction, are exactly reminiscent of the local fare in the countryside regions of Spain. The team is also introducing a brunch menu that's only available on Saturdays, Sundays, and public holidays (till 3pm) that include a Spanish version of the classic ham and eggs! Considering the general quality of Spanish ham, that sounds amazing to us!

With simple, classic fare done as the Spanish do - as an accompaniment to long, lovely evenings filled with wine and laughter - My Little Tapas bar is sure to steal your heart.
Taking a more authentic approach to tapas than usual, per its sister restaurant My Little Spanish Place, this tapas bar is all about the bona fide, Iberian originals - an all-Spanish wine list, five types of jamones carved-to-order, Spanish cheeses and only the most fundamental of Spanish snacks. The interior features rough-hewn woody tones and modern touches like bare bulbs. Spanish flare is evident in vintage posters, bullfighter-red napkins and rope accents that recall a traditional torero. The wine list is concise and convincing, each entry boasting its high Robert Parker and (Spanish equivalent) GUIA Penin scores, so you know that your choice will be a great one.
The cuisine is so classic and restrained that you can taste each ingredient that went into the dish. Andalusian flatbread features caramelized onions, piquillo peppers and a rioja reduction over grilled bread. The gambas are seasoned with smoky paprika and garlic, creating slurry so tasty that we recommend digging down into the dish long after the prawns are gone. For dessert, try the Chocolate Tart served with a traditional meringue sorbet with flavours of cinnamon. In all, My Little Tapas Bar's disarmingly chic combination of modern decor, warm vibe and delicious food has it poised to become your little tapas bar.

Set up in 2009 by two old friends who were dissatisfied with the then-available options for Indian cuisine, Nalan Restaurant (City Hall) has blossomed into a gem that spins out authentic Indian vegetarian fare meticulously prepared with traditional cooking methods-- no doubt the reason for their impressive pool of loyal patrons who return for a heartwarming taste of home-cooked food.Nalan’s dedication to their customers is clearly evident in their ability to cater to traditional Jain diets. Dishes without onion and garlic, such as Palak Paneer and Sbji Diwani-hundi, are commonplace and should you have any dietary restrictions or food allergies, Nalan’s skilled chefs are more than happy to whip something up for you without sacrificing taste or quality.The menu also features an impressive range of options from all across India. We are major fans of the Paneer Butter Masala, featuring satisfying cottage cheese cubes drenched in a creamy sauce of tomato and butter. Tip: soak up every last drop of goodness with some naan. If you’re looking for some Western fare, Nalan’s got you covered too, with exciting options like the Asparagus and Baby Bella salad and the Rigatoni with Broccoli, Walnuts and Ricotta. What’s there not to like?

The restaurant is temporarily operating out of Origin Grill, and guests are invited to immerse in a splendid, diversified dining experience with Japanese chef, Yutaro San, and omotenashi (Japanese hospitality) from the heart.

Under the leadership of Chef Yutaro Tsuchiya who has decades of experience and exposure to distinct influences from overseas working experiences and travels, the repertoire of gastronomic delights at NAMI showcases a mindful balance of the art of Japanese cuisine with international influences as techniques and flavours that Chef Yutaro has discovered from his exploration of different cultures are incorporated into the culinary creations. From slicing techniques to unique marinades, the culinary team’s craft of treating each ingredient differently with skill brings out the best of each produce. 

Hailing from Yokosuka, Yokohama, Chef Yutaro was raised near the sea, laying the foundation for his expertise in handling seafood and his deep-rooted appreciation for fresh seasonal produce, which forms the heart of the restaurant’s identity today. NAMI, which means wave in Japanese, transports the pulse of the sea from Japan to diners in Singapore with an unrelenting dedication to seasonality, flying in seasonal fresh catches from Japan frequently as the delicacies are available.

Guests can look forward to savouring quality produce at their peak in a la carte selections as well as curated set menus that are updated frequently to present only the best that are in season.

Appetisers are simple yet delicious. For example, the Cucumber with Sesame Oil is lightly seasoned and garnished with diced chilli padi, giving it a sweet and tangy flavour. The Preserved Egg is another crowd favourite. Cubes of salted eggs are served up on a platter decorated with carrots, beans and flowers. 

However, the star of the show at Nan Jing Restaurant is undeniably the Chilli Crab. Freshly cooked, the crab meat is juicy and succulent and tastes best when dipped in the thick and spicy Chilli Crab sauce. The Pork Trotter is another worthy contender. Fried with peanuts  and coriander, the Pork Trotters are a wonderful burst of flavours.

Order a warm bowl of Mushroom Soup to cleanse your palate. Filled with handmade meatballs and mushrooms, the soup is nutritious and refreshing. For those who are craving something more sinful, try the Deep Fried Pumpkin Pancake. Crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside, this dish presents the perfect balance of flavour.

Niku Katsumata prides itself on serving some of the finest beef produced in Japan, plated in the simplest ways to highlight the natural flavours of the meat, and paired with various complementary dishes to create a full, beef-centric meal. At its barest level, the beef here is of such high quality that it’s served up as as sashimi. For cooked beef, one of the specialities here is Tataki Wagyu, a premium A4 Grade Wagyu that’s lightly seared before being placed atop a bowl of rice and given the ‘chasuke’ treatment: a light, savoury bonito stock is poured over the dish, which gently coaxes even more flavour from the beef. You have the option to top this up with premium, umami-rich ingredients like caviar, foie gras, or ikura. You can also have the beef in the form of a magnificent set meal, the A4 Wagyu Beef Set, which features Japanese Pork Prosciutto, a selection of home-made pickles, a premium selection of  A4 Wagyu Beef, and a Japanese A4 Beef Curry Rice. The beef here, beautifully marbled, tender, and served very rare, is prepared by chef Tsuyoshi Katsumata in the most unusual of ways: it’s cooked over a crystal plate, a method that apparently evenly distributes the heat and cooks the meat gently, ensuring it remains perfectly juicy. The incredible flavour of the beef at Niku Katsumata has to be tasted to be believed. A word of warning: you may never go back to your supermarket varieties after this!

Promising a multi-sensory culinary journey, their eclectic dishes draw inspiration from China, India, Southern Europe, and Central and Southeast Asia. The custom-built grill is where the magic happens, dishing out specials like The Nomads ‘Plov’, a take on the Central Asian rice dish. Here, their ‘rice’ is replaced with a carnaroli risotto, while the meat is a mouth-watering combination of A4 Wagyu striplion and bone marrow. Every trimming of a great plov has been upgraded: Pickled heirloom carrots, tea quail eggs and branded raisins are found in each mouthful. You can try this dish in both their omakase-style Long Menu and Short Menu, aptly named The Nomad’s Journey and The Nomad’s Introductory respectively.

Engage your other senses in this unique pitch-black dining concept as you’re served ‘mystery’ food while being guided by visually-impaired hosts. Serving up to 12-course tasting menus, NOX combines booze and food in this experiential concept with flair. With dishes centred around its alcoholic beverages, the highlight here is their wide menu of alcohol and cocktails offered. Signature cocktails include Breakfast for Champions. Combining whiskey, cream, and maple syrup, this delicious drink is filling, sweet and potent - best for someone with high alcohol tolerance. Smooth, velvety whiskey with a light taste, this drink is one to savour for a good burn. For a visually appealing cocktail that creates an almost soft glow, go for their Not A Frozen Margarita cocktail. A frozen alcoholic slushie, this drink is reminiscent of old-school ice kacang with a boozy twist that’s fun and deliciously sweet. Another signature cocktail to try here is their Coco-NOT. Made with green tea, gin, pandan syrup and roasted rice, this unique cocktail is robust with a hint of pandan, creating a unique flavour profile that is sweet and fragrant. Slightly on the drier side, this drink is great with an appetiser like their Seared Ahi Tuna and Duck Fat Roasted Potatoes with Bacon. This pairing is great for diners looking for a mix of flavours and textures. Serving non-alcoholic drink pairings on their menu as well, non-alcohol lovers can go for their set of three mocktails to go with their meal too. Dubbed as mystery cocktails, surprise your tastebuds with flavours that are specially curated to your food menu that will enhance your dining experience with NOX.

It's no surprise that he aims to recreate that nostalgic feeling through this quaint, warmly-lit cafe. But it isn't all just sentiment though — the food served here packs a punch too.

A good selection of Western appetisers, mains, and pastas are available, with a section of the menu dedicated to Rosti. We recommend the hearty Crispy Duck Confit with Lingonberry Sauce on days you're feeling ravenous, or the Crabmeat Arrabiatta for when you need a bowl of comfort food. The Farmer's Rosti, that comes with a veal bratwurst and sunny-side up, is also not to be missed.

With brunch as Oberstrasse’s speciality, you’ll be pleased to know that you can enjoy these staples at dinner, too. The Instagram-worthy Brioche French Toast tastes as good as it looks, with homemade jam, Mascarpone cheese and maple granola atop buttery slices of toast. For something more substantial, go for the German Breakfast that comes with a pretzel, eggs, ham, sausages, and more.

Pair your food with some equally good coffee, brewed from beans roasted locally by OBX Coffee Roasters.

This time it’s nothing new or revolutionary but who could ever complain about finally finding cafe grub that marries both style and substance?

Holding the fort with their artisanal beverages, they nonetheless wow the crowd with their tasteful menu that will have you coming back for more. As you sip on a refreshing Cold Brew or the absolutely delightful Cold Matcha Milk, dig into the Portobello Aglio Olio or the perfectly beer-battered Fish & Chips for maximum enjoyment. Raining Outside? The Buttered Corn Chowder will warm both your tummy and your soul instantly. If you’re looking for something with a cleaner palate, the Salmon & Soba ticks all the right boxes. The sous vide salmon and warm soba gets a flavourful kick from the heady combination of peanut, red chilli, and citrus teriyaki, making for a dish that will titillate your taste buds.

Think it can’t get any better? We’ve saved the best for last, as dessert heaven comes in the form of Old Hen Kitchen’s Matcha Affogato. Drizzle the little pot of earthy, robust koicha over a scoop of creamy vanilla ice cream and speculoos crumb, then take a little of everything with your spoon for a taste of unadulterated pleasure. Take our word for it, there’s really nothing quite like it.

Between countless servings from the raw bar served chef-to-counter and dishes right of that smoky binchotan grill, there’s serious dedication in being a spot for guests to get introduced, explore and experience the ever-growing trend of Craft Sake. From ancient styles to modern, sour, fruity, aged experimental brews, their in-house Sake Sommelier and team taste every single sake that comes through the doors, of which their sake list rotates almost weekly.“Our tasting notes are ours. Sakes are tasted by us first, notes are written by us, for you”, they flexed. “When a set of sake is sold out, it gets replaced by something entirely new.”The bar also features a curation of whiskies, expanding on traditional highball culture. From a more basic Hi-Nikka, a sweeter smoky variant of your typical Suntory Kakubin, to an unimaginable Bruichladdich Port Charlotte Heavy Peated Highball, to a bougie (yet true-to-taste) Blue Label Highball, this place has it. In fact, ask the booze-head behind the bar for an Iceless Highball to experience the peak of highball drinking.Seafood flies in four times weekly, with some fish reserved for careful aging to enhance their flavours. Apart from serious sushi and sashimi, there’s the Overloaded Maki, a playful interpretation of loaded fries but with decadent fancies of chopped tuna belly and uni. The Carabinero Prawn Sushi is an upgrade from the traditional Botan Ebi sushi, with a sweet tail pressed into hand-beaten red vinegar rice and that prized Carabinero head packing an extra-luxe tomalley. Their handrolls too, are fun tasting yet simple, fuss free and really worth it.When you’ve had your fill of the Raw Bar, the grill offers wood, fire and passion. Choosing Japanese Binchotan for that important smoky-crisp flavour, a large portion of the menu relies on the potential of the grill, be it yakitori, or steak, or fish. The traditional Buta Kakuni is developed with over-the-coal charred Japanese leeks, burnt onions and roasted garlic for depth of flavour to the pork belly braising sauce. Their Foie Gras, brushed with a house-blend kushiyaki sauce is binchotan grilled rather than pan-seared, giving smoky depth and flavour to an otherwise familiar item. Even their Flamed Edamame gets bougie with the coals and is finished with a rich lemon butter.

A revolutionary collaboration between the Spa Espirit Group, Head Chef Oliver Truesdale Jutras, Souschef Phoebe Oviedo and award-winning food garden specialists, Edible Garden City, Open Farm Community is an urban farmland, horticultural hub, and restaurant all packed into one. At the heart of it all is one simple philosophy: to provide Singaporeans with a space to reconnect with nature whilst educating the young and old about local farming and the food we eat. The sprawling outdoor space features a garden brimming with herbs and vegetable produce, as well as educational breakout spaces alongside lawn bowling lanes and table tennis tables. True to their goal of educating city dwellers about the food we eat, tours of the vegetable and fruit orchards, talks, and gardening workshops are available too. The centrepiece is the gorgeous restaurant, a building with floor-to-ceiling glass windows and a high ceiling, the perfect place to unwind and tuck into some simple and honest fare.

The kitchen here adopts a strict no-no policy towards processed ingredients, imported produced, and unsustainable farming practices. This means that ingredients used here are mostly locally-sourced and always fresh - even the pasta is made fresh in-house! The menu is also one striking example of Open Farm Community’s dedication to serving honest food, with lengthy names laying out the different ingredients used in each dish. The flavours here are simple yet robust, focused around local farms and heritage, as epitomized by the Laksa Pappardelle, featuring soft shell prawn tempura, a spicy coconut based sauce and fresh laksa leaves from the garden; or the light and fresh watermelon salad, replete with lime and mint to balance the housemade ricotta from local Hay Dairies goat milk. A highlight was the Barramundi, straight from the waters off Pulau Ubin, combined with a sumptuous seaweed butter and organic dou miao, with puffed black rice crumbled over for a textural contrast.

Now, whether you’re looking for romantic date spot, or a place where the kids can have some fun, Open Farm Community definitely provides an unforgettable experience for all.

While seasonings and sauces have their place, these two essentials go the longest way in ensuring a perfectly juicy, endlessly flavourful cut from pasture to plate. This is the philosophy of Opus Grill, the stunning mahogany clad steakhouse at voco Orchard Singapore. Featuring an impressive dining room with handsome furnishings, it has the feel of a solid modern grill experience long before you get a peek at the well-curated menu of grill basics. The meat starts with 18 to 36 days of dry aging in a one-of-a-kind Himalayan salt tiled cabinet. The in-house curation makes a tasteful difference in the flavour and juiciness of the steak, and while there are a handful of choice cuts available, the dry-aged Rangers Valley Angus OP Rib with a Marble Score of 4 is a fast favourite. This sizeable beauty, meant for two diners, is carefully grilled upon an open-flame charcoal grill for an ideal flame-licked crust. Plus, you can choose from a selection of sauces and delectable side orders to go with the it.For less carnivorous diners, Opus is the first restaurant in the city to gain the MSC ecolabel for sustainable seafood, so you know the seafood come from the best possible place. Finish off with a charcoal grilled banana smoked with salted caramel and served with refreshing coconut and calamansi ice-cream - just the right kiss of sweetness to end your decadent evening.

Our perfectly seared 150-day grain-fed Australian Angus tenderloin didn't need much else but salt, which comes in a trio of flavours: rosemary, black lava and paprika. Sidekicks like the Mac & Cheese and mashed potatoes allow the main attractions to shine. However, a few, like the smoked risotto threaten to steal the show: al dente rice and crunchy bites of charred leek, laced with pecorino cheese and charcoal oil, make it far less cloying than it sounds."" -Time Out Singapore</p></li><li><h5>DISHES WE LOVE</h5><p>Watermelon & Feta Salad, Lamb Skewer, Whiskey-Aged Wagyu Tomahawk, Wagyu & Lobster, Grilled Butterflied Spring Chicken, Opus Over-the-Top Fries</p></li><li><h5>TRIPADVISOR CERTIFICATE OF EXCELLENCE</h5><p>This restaurant was awarded the TripAdvisor Certificate of Excellence in 2017 for its outstanding service and quality while maintaining as a favourite among reviewers on TripAdvisor, the world's largest travel site.</p></li><li><h5>EASTER SUNDAY CHAMPAGNE BRUNCH (17 APR)</h5><p>EARLY BIRD OFFER!

The salad bar holds its own in the centre of the room. You know it's serious stuff when the Caesar salad is tossed in a huge block of parmesan, ensuring that you get fresh chunks of nutty goodness. And if that's not enough, there's also a staggering selection of ingredients you can add to your salad, along with an assortment of seafood, soup and other cold starters.
The main courses are prepared fresh in small quantities each time (to ensure quality), right behind the counter in the library kitchen, where curious diners can observe all the action going on behind the scenes. The themes and menus change daily, so loyal patrons will always be kept on their toes. In fact, don't miss the noodle station that's located on the terrace. With a menu of local noodle dishes such as laksa and more, cooked-to-order, what's there not to love?
During the weekends, Oscar's buffet ramps it up a notch with free-flow champagne, house wine, and beer to go along with their extensive selection of freshly shucked oysters, seafood on ice, and live carving stations. (Jul 2015)</p></li><li><h5>THE BUZZ</h5><p>

We especially love Dario's twists on classics like the smoke-infused Old Cuban, made with rum and citrus, or the bizarre Reverse Gin and Tonic, a mix of gin and tonic syrup that's carbonated at freezing temperatures at the table, ensuring a crisp, if a little science-fiction like, drink. On top of this, ask for any classic you can name, which Dario and his team will fix for you with pleasure.The main appeal for us, though, is Dario's pet project: he takes bottled spirits and finishes them in specially-treated casks to infuse them with new flavour dimensions. Your favourite whisky or rum can be turned into a completely different drink given some extra time in a sherry cask, or a gin you thought you knew and loved is given a new depth of flavour through infusions with all manner of fruit peel, herbs, and spices. It's a real mad scientist's lab here, and one that's guaranteed to change the way you enjoy your favourite spirits. If you ask Dario for recommendations, he can turn one of these finished spirits into a cocktail for you.If you like your drinks with a little bit of mystery, some magic, and lots of flair, seek out The Other Room, if you can find it!

That and the delighted sounds of your fellow diners feasting on large plates of traditional Indonesian fare. It almost feels like you have left the hustle and bustle of the CBD and entered into a lively Indonesian village, with boisterous laughter filling the large oaken dining room, peppered with various traditional Indonesian curios. The simple, family-style seating adds to the feel of the place. Pagi Sore is your lunch or dinnertime escape from the urban jungle.
At the Far East Square outlet, subtle touches such as the display of Angklungs (a traditional Indonesian musical instrument) at the cashier counter, and little hand-carved wooden animals perched atop shelves add to the traditional feel of the place. Continuing in the vein of celebrating Indonesian culture, a rich tapestry woven with gold threads is also displayed at the front counter.
With its humble beginnings as a Nasi Padang stall, Pagi Sore has come a long way, but one thing still remains the same in all its 24 years - their sensational recipes that have drawn crowds for generations. Although Indonesian fare has a reputation of being too hot for most to handle, the tastes here have been slightly adjusted for the local palate, with a special focus on each of the five major flavours. In fact, as we journeyed through the menu, we appreciated the progression of sweet, savoury, sour, spicy and umami.
The bustling atmosphere when we visited is a testament to Pagi Sore's popularity, so be sure to make a reservation to guarantee yourself a seat. Otherwise, be ready to torturously watch as hungry patrons lap up plates of Indonesian goodness as you wait in line.

Established in 1956, and widely credited in the contested race of who was creator of the Singapore Chili Crab, Palm Beach has perfected its recipes and service over its long tenure. Whether you frequented the East Coast outlet back in the day with family, now visit for entertaining clients with local flair, or bring your out-of-town friends to One Fullerton for a meal and view to impress, it seems like we all know and love Palm Beach.
To those skeptics who hail a heartland hawker as more quintessentially Singaporean, we hear you. But once to have enjoyed succulent Black Pepper Crab and fresh squeezed fruit blends under crystal candelabras and the watchful eye of the Merlion, with a cooled interior to beat the heat, and a shiny, modern décor, we bet you will be a convert.
Situated at the coveted spot where the Singapore River meets Marina Bay, views are second-to-none. While news of Palm Beach's greatness has drawn crowds from all over, our secret to avoid tourists is to be seated indoors. Expansive windows allow views to be just as idyllic, and we find that the temperature is more conducive to digging in to their various delicacies.
And what delicacies there are! Sparing no expense in sourcing the freshest of seafood, vegetables and ingredients for house-made sauces, it is a pleasant surprise to see that price tags for dishes have seemingly not changed that much from 1956! Recipes have been fine-tuned since then, but classics like Sri Lankan crab prepared 11 different ways, and Honey Tangy Fish remain largely the same and will always be held close to our hearts, and stomachs.

If you've lived in Singapore for a while, chances are you've heard about Pasta Brava which was established in 1991. And it wouldn't be surprising if the name conjures up word associations like ""authentic Italian"", and ""delicious"".
East truly meets west as the Luceri family serves traditional Italian dishes at a conservation shophouse in Tanjong Pagar. With its central location, it's perfect for corporate lunches or romantic dinners, and if you don't believe us, perhaps the numerous accolades that take up an entire wall near the entrance can back up our claim.
They deserve a standing ovation and a ""Bravissima!"" for their simple yet delicious renditions, many of whose ingredients can be counted on one hand like the Insalata Caprese and Calamari Fritti. The extensive menu has you covered from antipasti to dolci, but as their name suggests, the homemade pastas are their specialty.
Consider their signature dish, the Mezzelune Ripiene di Zucca. Half moon shaped pumpkin ravioli comes in a divine red capsicum cream sauce. At first bite, you get the sweetness of the pumpkin, which is then finished off with the sweetness of the red capsicum. Between this and their chocolate lava cake, we're hard-pressed to choose which the sweeter escape is.

Pasta Fresca translates to “Fresh Pasta” and, staying true to its name, this heartwarming establishment offers the widest range of homemade fresh pasta, completely without preservatives and additives, in Singapore. From familiar favourites like Spaghetti and Linguine, to eclectic picks like Panzerotti, Conchiglie, and Pappardelle, there’s something for everyone.

Seafood lovers should not miss the Polpa Di Granchio, a luscious sauce of soft crabmeat sauteed with garlic, crushed black pepper, cherry tomatoes, and white wine in tomato sauce. If you’re looking for something more decadent, the bestseller, Al Funghi E Salsiccia, features homemade Italian pork sausage and mushrooms sauteed in light cream.
An avid pizza fan? The selection here won’t disappoint you either. Our favourite was definitely the Rucola, Mozzarella Fresca E Pomodorini, the signature pizza topped with generous portions of cherry tomatoes, fresh mozzarella cheese, and fresh rucola. The Parma Ham was a smashing delight as well - who can resist the king of Italian Ham smothered all over a crusty pizza dough?

Lucky for us, getting such delectable pasta requires nothing more than a car (or train) ride into town. Located along Craig Road in Tanjong Pagar, Pastaria Abate is a casual eatery that has seemingly cracked the culinary code, serving up amazingly delicious pasta in an inviting environment at prices that won’t break the bank.
Embark on your meal with several Italian appetisers such as the warm Garlic Bread made in-house, or the Antipasta Full Board showcasing cuts of prosciutto, salami and more. Then move on to the pasta because, my oh my, is it divine. Select your favourite pasta from egg-based fettucine to rigatoni and pair it with any of the 18 rich and flavourful sauces available. Stellar options include the Al Ragu, where the traditional chunky beef sauce is slowly cooked overnight. The Mixed Seafood sauce is another crowd-pleaser, with its generous heaping of prawns, mussels, and squid all lightly cooked in a seafood broth. And what better way to round off the meal than with a glass of Italian wine from the eatery’s wine cellar?
Set in a warm and cosy environment, the humble Pastaria Abate charms with delightful renditions of classic Italian pasta meals at wallet-friendly prices. (Jan 2018)

That has been the cornerstone of Patara Fine Thai Cuisine’s cooking for the last twenty years, and their longevity in this country of fickle diners is testament that it works.
Nestled in the cosy compound of Tanglin, Patara Fine Thai Cuisine combines premium ingredients and traditional cooking techniques to conjure Thai dishes that will warm the body and soul. There’s no better way to kick things off than with a Patara Premium, designed to be shared by two. This showcase sampler features top-sellers such as the resplendent Chor Muang, or handcrafted blue flower dumplings stuffed with caramelised chicken, sweet turnip, and peanut filling. If you’re a fan of beef, then opt for Nua Yang. Here, a tender 300 days grain-fed Australian beef tenderloin is cooked to perfection and paired with a tangy spicy tamarind sauce. Patara Fine Thai Cuisine also does not lack for any seafood options, ranging from fresh lobsters, prawns, to several kinds of fish, so you won’t go wrong with any pick. For us, the Whole Seabass cannot be beat thanks to its complementary broth concocted from lime, garlic, and chilli.

The Brauhaus is also a stellar Bavarian restaurant, churning out plates of meaty German favourites to go with those beers, as well as heaps of friendly German “Geselligkeit,” or “sociability”. 

Channeling an authentic German tavern, the trappings here are gorgeous and rustic, and usher you into a truly German experience. The food does the rest. The great classics of the cuisine are all here, including a massive Roasted Whole Pork Knuckle on the bone, served with tart Sauerkraut and Bavarian bread dumplings. There’s also German meatloaf, called Leberkas, served grilled with a side of fresh cucumber salad, a sunny side up egg, and rich Bavarian mustard. Deep from the heart of Bavaria comes the Beef Beer Goulash, a rich beef stew given extra layers of flavour by some dark beer, served with mounds of Bavarian egg noodles to soak up all that delicious gravy. 

It’s not German food without an entire section of the menu dedicated to sausages, and here you can get your fix of Currywurst, Munich Weisswurst, and herby Sausage Snail. Pile on the meat with a serving of Schnitzel, a battered cutlet of pork or chicken, served with a variety of sauces that will forever change your mind about German food being bland and uninteresting. Needless to say, chug down some beers. They’re brewed on-site and are some of the tastiest on the island. (Feb 2018)

Established in Chijmes since 2006 (formerly known as Cosafe Maid Café), PNC has watched its space grow beyond what was first envisaged in its maiden rebranding exercise in 2014 to appeal to a variety of target audience. Today, we are taking this opportunity to re-evaluate, regroup, and rebrand our existing identity. And we must be prepared to innovate, and embrace the reality of rapid digitalisation.Going forward, our establishment has a newly adopted vision of transforming into a local promising label that distinguishes itself from competitors within the F&B industry, yet remains perfectly affiliated to PNC – Pemenco: the expression of ‘Peaty, meaty, and company’ is the inspiration behind this original brand name.This complete rebranding campaign takes time and only PNC’s loyal, and royal, patrons will eventually attest to its successful business transformation into Pemenco, which is already a work-in-progress. From a stylishly designed logo in new corporate colours of brown and orange hues, to its commitment towards enhancing service orientation, as well as freshly curated menu of the finest culinary by its contemporary resident-chef and other exceptional personalities, Pemenco will evolve from “grapes to peat” – wines to whisky in other words. And we must continue to remain resilient even as the going gets tough.While the nature of rebranding is painstaking, it is both necessary and inevitable from our business point of view. In essence, the understanding and renewed support of the esteemed Chijmes management towards our latest aspiration will certainly enable Pemenco to break newer ground and pursue remarkable growth under greater stewardship amid these trying times.

Helmed by Chef Ricky Liew, who is known for his creative presentation and dishes, the menu here features a number of dishes that are easy on the eyes and palate. With no MSG and minimal oil used in his creations, the dishes here are perfect for the health conscious.

Try Chef Liew’s signature dish like “Bi Feng Tang” Style Crispy Cod. Crunchy pieces of fresh fish is served with caramelised onions and presented on a bed of greens, sprinkled liberally with chilli. Meat lovers will love the Honey Glazed Barbecue Pork - smoky, tender chunks of meat from Spain drenched in a rose-infused honey sauce that is rich, tangy, and sweet. The sauce goes perfectly with the meat and can be eaten on its own, though some diners may choose to mop up the decadent sauce with some steamed rice. 

Diners who can’t decide on what to eat can opt for a special omakase style meu. Simply inform the restaurant of a budget, and Chef Liew will create dishes that are not on the menu from fresh ingredients he finds at the market.

Upon entering the cool, minimalist space taken by Pizza Fabbrica on Bussorah Street, your eye is drawn straight through to the back by the glinted reflections of a gorgeous copper-clad oven, ebulliently glowing from its wood-fired embers within. It sits behind a glassed-in kitchen, bustling with chefs pressing dough and boiling pasta. The window is a theme at the restaurant, its storefront also featuring floor-to-ceiling versions that allows light and action to flow from inside to outside beautifully. The rest of the design is as if stepping into the mind of a graphic designer, complete with techy textures of chrome and wire, along with charming infographic posters displaying optimal wine and beer pairings. It’s a refreshingly minimal, but not understyled look that shows a new side to the tired hipster aesthetic, and a very unexpected one for a pizza restaurant. 

Let the posters guide you to your ideal beverage, picking from the small but efficient bar of beers and wines on tap. From the menu, the pizzas are the obvious choice, in which you can taste the handiwork of that impressive oven.  The Funghi Scarmorza features a woodsy mix of mushrooms with a drizzle of truffle oil and rich melted cheese that’s an immediate palate pleaser. The Prosciutto Crudo con Rucola is another winner with more than the usual volume of toppings of Parma ham and peppery rocket suspended in a milky mozzarella. The Vegetariana has the same cheese, which is cut nicely by balsamic grilled eggplant, capsicum and zucchini. All the pizzas are grounded by a tasty crust, chewy in the center and bubbled and scorched at the edges. A variety of pastas is also available for the non-pizza straggler of your dining party. Cap off the meal with a heavenly scented, creamy Saffron Panna Cotta and you won’t be disappointed!

That would mean little, however, if the food wasn’t authentic and delicious, but fret not - the restaurant’s commitment to good food is obvious from the very first bite. That, together with a relaxed ambience and attentive service staff, makes for a meal to remember.

If you’re looking to have a little taste of Greece, then dig into a large helping of Moussaka, an oven-baked casserole made of grilled eggplant, minced beef, decadently creamy cheese, and various spices. Hot, rich, and a real belly buster, it’d be a rare person who didn’t come away from it feeling satisfied. Do try the Grilled Stuffed Squid with Feta Cheese as well – every chewy mouthful is enhanced by the fragrance of sliced garlic. It’s not an overly complicated dish, but man if it isn’t good.

Place to READ doesn’t just serve Greek food – there’s a great selection of pastas and pizzas too, among other Western fare. You won’t regret the Chilli Crab Sauce Pasta, with an authentic take on the sauce that won’t disappoint fans of the Singaporean classic. Served with helpings of scallop and shrimp, you’re sure to get every cent of your money’s worth. Hearty, good value, and a good place to unwind – that just about sums up Place to READ!

Diners get to customise their own three-course meal here, and can even choose to pair their selections with a wine from the extensive list available. The Portobello Mushroom With Truffle Chantilly Cream is an excellent soup to start with. Light, earthy, and simple, this dish whets the appetite and prepares the palate for the dishes to come. Another popular starter here is the Porters Crab Meat Croquette. Served with homemade chilli sauce, this dish is crunchy, meaty, and not greasy in the slightest. 

The Pan Seared Foie Gras is an excellent main, and a crowd favourite. The duck liver is seared to tender perfection and served with brioche and mixed berry compote, making for a dish that is sweet, buttery, and melts in your mouth. The Papillote Sea Bass is a generous serving of fish with potato fondant and lemon on the side, making for a dish that is tangy with a hint of earthiness tempered by the umami flavour of the fish.

Housed in one of the most iconic buildings on Keong Saik Road, this dynamic destination offers four venues within one building. Guests can combine the distinctively different restaurants and bars to create their perfect mix, or visit individually depending on the occasion, mood and time of day.
Designed as PTT Family's 'home' in Singapore, Potato Head Singapore has the intimate feel of a private house - the first floor is the kitchen - the dynamic burger restaurant Three Buns; the second its living room - a relaxed restaurant with table service; the third its private studio - a decadent drinking den; and the rooftop its garden - a tropical-paradise open-air bar. The different rooms of the house are a haven in the heart of the city, a retreat for Singapore's creative crowd from the arts, fashion, film, music and design worlds.

Named after the device used to extract juice from crushed grapes, Praelum is one of the few places that has been continuously lauded by Wine & Dine Magazine for their excellent wine list. There is also a selection of cheeses and other dishes for diners’ pairings. 

With a walk-in cellar home to over a thousand bottles of carefully procured wines and a bottle list that changes weekly, this is one place that truly knows its grapes. Wines are sold by the glass using the Enomatic and Coravin wine preservation systems, which minimises spoilage of the wine. The knowledgeable sommeliers are also able to advise diners and make recommendations for different palates. 

Diners can pair their choice of wine with farmhouse cheese platters and truffle honey. The tarte flambee is another good option, and comes with a range of premium toppings, including roma tomatoes and gruyere cheese. For something a little moreish, opt for the Stockyard Wagyu Ribeye. The fresh cut of beef is cooked to your liking and slathered in a rich beef demi glace sauce which gives the dish a strong flavour without overpowering the taste of the meat.

This humble South Indian staple has long been a go-to dish for many people across all walks of life, who find themselves chowing down on this dish at all hours of the day. 

And as big fans of this simple dish, we know that some of the best prata can be found in Clementi at a little establishment called Prata Alley, located in the shopping mall 321 Clementi. Unlike your old-school neighbourhood joints, Prata Alley kicks this dish up a notch, serving up inventive fare. One such dish is the The Big One, which seamlessly blends a mozzarella cheese prata base with pizza toppings such as pesto chicken and shiitake mushrooms. 

You can expect other specialties too, such as the Turmeric Rush, which showcases a generous plate of nasi goreng cooked with a special blend of spices. Of course diners who prefer traditional dishes would enjoy Prata Alley’s rendition of Chicken Sambal Briyani, where you can bite into chunks of chicken that’s both tender and spicy at the same time.  

By putting a new spin onto the age-old prata dish, Prata Alley has created a bevy of delicious and innovative dishes for all to enjoy. (Jun 2018)

The word preludio, which may be translated as ""introduction"" or ""prelude"", alludes to the constant beginning of something new.
For its debut, Preludio will open with Monochrome, where the restaurant will be inspired in black and white. To remove colour from an object is to strip it down to its fundamental self - everything raw and everything pure. Opening with this rudimentary idea of black and white seemed only befitting for Preludio as it embarks on this unconventional journey.

The simple lines and casual furnishings offer a roomy backyard feel, but elevated with design-centric touches, so it's more of what we would imagine Gwyneth Paltrow's back lawn to be like rather than our next-door neigbour's. Vintage green brick and terracotta tiles are reflected from the rattan-clad mirrors, all cast with a romantic glow come nighttime. The set-up, along with the varied menu, allow Prive to be a great spot for both brunch with the family, or an after work hangout with friends. The menu has brought along the most-loved dishes from Keppel Bay including Eggs Benedict, crispy Fish & Chips we can't seem to get out of our heads, satisfying Impossible Meat burgers, and divine Sticky Date Pudding. Being added to the mix are stone-baked pizzas, hearty brunch as well as local favourites like the Heura Hainanese Chicken Rice and Traditional Chicken Curry.

The charming spot quickly gained a cult following for its hearty takes on savoury café classics alongside its famed shoestring fries and indulgent desserts. Fast forward 19 years later and PS. Cafe has expanded to include nine more outlets under its fold. Loyal fans, however, still return to where it all began for servings of hearty nosh and a dollop of nostalgia. The cosy, laidback space immediately transports you away from the hustle and bustle of Orchard Road. Wood furniture dominate the decor while a charming bar takes its place in a cosy corner complete with an alluring bar top and eclectic shelves of liquor.

With a Bellini or a White Bouquet Sangria in hand, tuck into timeless PS. classics such as the PS. Fluffy Pancakes, the Portobello Brunch Souffle, or the irresistible PS. Brunch Burger, alongside the famed Truffle Shoestring Fries. Health junkies will especially enjoy the Superseed Granola, and the protein-packed Kale Florentine while those craving some local flavours should look forward to the mouthwatering Laksa Pesto Spaghetti and Chicken Tau Kwa. All-day treats include specialty sandwiches such as the Mushroom Croque Monsieur and the Club Sandwich, as well as the iconic Crab Tart, where handpicked blue swimmers are pan-fried with chili and kaffir before being drizzled with luscious prawn bisque sauce and homemade harissa.

There’s no need to worry about leaving smelling like a meat market either, since the premium exhaust nozzles ensure the air is clean and fresh.

Beef Ribeye Cap steak, Wagyu Striploin, and Pork Neck are just some of the premium cuts of meat you can order and cook to desired doneness at this spot. The highlight of the menu may be the delicious cuts of meat, but there is also a host of side dishes or baechu on offer here. Choose from deliciously spicy Kimchi or the milder Selleoli Jorim - tart pickled celery.  There is also the Eomuk Guk - a hearty Busan-style dish made with fish cakes, fishballs, vegetables, and rice cakes simmered in a rich broth. Diners looking to wash down their rich meal with a tipple or two are in luck - an extensive menu of Korean beers and soju is available.

Qi Lai Feng aims to enhance the hotpot dining experience with the unique “muscle fish”. A type of fish that is grown under strict conditions with a specific diet, its taste is similar to pork belly — firm, chewy, and delectable. Available exclusively at Qi Lai Feng, they’ve centred their menu and dishes around it with dry pots, soup pots, and side dishes.

The Mala Fish Pot is a great option for diners looking for a kick. Made with fish, Sichuan peppercorns, and chilli, this fiery dish has the searing flavours Singaporeans have come to love, made richer by the addition of silky fish. Top it with noodles and meat to soak up the broth for the perfect meal. For something a little milder, try the Tomato Fish Pot. Sweeter and tangier than Mala, the tomato in this soup gives the dish a rich and subtle flavour that goes well with rice. Try the Collagen Q Fish Ribs soup. Clear and packed with nutrients, this mainstay of hotpot is also available here, made with fish instead.

Featuring a hint of coconut and spice, this spicy broth makes a delicious dip for pork belly or beef. For the non-spicy hotpot lovers, Qi Li Xiang has got you covered with their fragrant tomato hotpot base as well. While cooking the ingredients inside of the broth, it gets thicker and more flavorful over time. Make sure to leave some stomach at the end for a bowl of soup after your meal. If you're looking for the ultimate in indulgence, order a plate of scallops and abalone to enhance the flavour profile of your broth. They also serve house food specials and we recommend ordering a plate of Braised Mix and Match to share while you wait for your meats to cook. You can choose from a variety of dishes, including braised pork intestines, pork ears, beancurd and liver.

Quaich Bar is one of the most exquisite whisky bars in Singapore. Since its opening in 2007, it has played host to countless social gatherings among friends and catered to the every need of business leaders looking to entertain colleagues or clients with a taste for the finer things in life. In the true spirit of this tradition, it is therefore apt that Quaich (pronounced ‘quake’) is named after the Gaelic cup, a symbol of welcome and friendship.
We started in 2005 as a humble retail kiosk in Tanglin Mall called “The Whisky Store”. At that time, the market lacked a dedicated whisky bar so we pursued our passion, opening Singapore’s first whisky bar a year later at Waterfront Plaza.
The venture soon reaped rewards in terms of notable accolades for our contribution to whisky culture in Singapore, being awarded the ‘Great Whisky Bar of the World’ title by the international whisky publication ‘Whisky Magazine’ in 2006. In 2007 the bar was renamed Quaich Bar, as it remains today.
In 2010, Quaich Bar was voted ‘Top 10 Best Unique Bars’ by regional gastronomic publication, ‘Epicure’. It has since become a stop-over for master distillers from around the world who regularly conduct introductions or workshops to showcase their signature brands.
After nine years of spreading the word of good whisky at the original outlet nestled at the corner of Waterfront Plaza next to Grand Copthorne Waterfront Hotel, a second outlet was opened at South Beach Avenue, next to JW Marriott Hotel, in 2016.

The Debal Galinhia or Chicken Devil Curry is a chicken dish named after the devil himself for its potent blend of spices, and for those that can handle some heat, it's a must try. The hearty Ros Befe presents a traditional pot roast with a boldly spiced gravy that's good to the last, fork-tender bite. The Turmeric Cabbage is a filling dish in vibrant marigold colours. Another pleasingly bright dish is the Patchri, a beautiful composition of deep purple eggplant with sweet and sour sauce. The Fretu Bendi, or fried okra, is contrastingly crisp and toothsome.

The elaborate sauces and flavours of French cuisine meet the à la minute robustness of Chinese cooking, with each cuisine getting half of the menu, allowing diners to create a fascinating fusion meal unlike any other. Helmed by famed Executive Chef Jean-Charles Dubois, this restaurant spreads out over four live cooking stations that turn locally-sourced and organically-grown produce into elegant plates, a truly unique hotel buffet experience. There is also an à la carte menu that sprawls the full gamut of these two rich cuisines. In this fashion, you may see a classic pot-roasted French hen, a corn-fed beauty cooked in a pot with French potatoes and vegetables served up with a plate of stir-fried Frog Legs in a fiery Szechuan sauce. Or a beautifully slow-braised Wagyu Cheek served alongside crunchy Sweet & Sour Kurobuta Pork, or scallion-kissed wok-fried Angus Beef Cubes.
Both cuisines unite in their love for seafood. On the French side, there’s a massive platter of premium Fruits de Mer (fruits of the sea), including Alaskan king crab, freshly shucked oysters, and scallop carpaccio on an iced platter. On the Chinese side, the ubiquitous Abalone, except here served sashimi-style with a sea urchin sauce and a sprinkling of lemony breadcrumbs. Dessert is a grab-bag of options: delicate French gateaux flavoured with strawberries, dark chocolate, or praline rub shoulders with Asian flavours like red bean, yuzu, and mango sticky rice. The quality of cooking is truly unmatched, and who knows, you may discover some delicious food pairings for yourself at this culinary wonderland. Come experience one of the island’s most exciting fusion experiences today!

Sashimi is a must to start the meal, and the fresh slices of raw fish presented elegantly on a platter are definite crowd-pleasers. Grilled meats are a highlight at Rakuichi — your eyes feast first on the generous cubes of meat on skewers, presented on a small charcoal-grill and cooked before you. It’s enough to work up an appetite (not that you’ll need to) for the smoke-kissed, lightly charred meats bursting with flavour. There’s also comfort food to indulge in, such as soft-shell crab karaage, plump breaded oysters that are crispy and creamy at the same time, as well as enoki mushrooms wrapped in thick strips of fatty bacon. Put this on your go-to list if you’re a Japanese food lover.

Imported from an exclusive butcher in California, the grass-fed produce have been transformed into perfectly marbled steaks with an even ratio of fat to meat. Chicken, pork ribs, and pork belly are also available for diners looking for something other than beef.

The Angus Short Ribs are one of their popular items, and it’s no surprise why — the ribs are tender and flavourful. Made from meat selected specifically for smoking, the thick ribs have been cooked for six hours that result in a tender, melt-in-your-mouth bite. The Iberico Duroc Short Ribs are another great option for diners who prefer a beefier alternative. Seasoned with dry rub and smoked for four hours, these ribs are sweet, spicy, and juicy. For something a little lighter, go for the Smoked Chicken Flatbread, topped with veggies and a helping of delightfully tender chicken.

Established in 1976 in a literal red house in East Coast, the restaurant has had its roots in the community for some time now, and its growth to various outlets across the island is a testament to its tasty fare. The original red house was a bastion for just-caught fish and crustaceans, delivered fresh from local fishing boats. The crimson-coloured facade was a symbol of prosperous and communal dining, further adorned with traditional red lanterns.
Now, the Clarke Quay outlet has very few red-coloured accoutrements, as the decor takes on a more understated look. For a casual step up from the outdoor seafood restaurants, this incarnation of Red House fits the bill perfectly, favouring simple functionality over flair. The one red item that's not going anywhere though, is their famed Chilli Crab, and with good reason. While there's much debate over which recipe reigns supreme in Singapore, Red House is consistently named among the top contenders. Here, the spicy gravy tastes especially homemade and doesn't mask the freshness of the crab.
With a bilingual menu written in both English and Chinese, Red House Seafood offers patrons a wealth of seafood options split into categories, all kept at more reasonable price points than you may expect. Prepared using a mix of Chinese and local Singaporean cooking methods, menu items include savoury dishes, like Fried Hor Fun, Lobster Pao Fan, and Creamy Custard Sauce Lobster that are all absolute must-tries.

You can order their signature Fusion Bak Kut Teh, featuring pork ribs in a rich tonkotsu-style soup laced with punchy spices, and served up with a ramen soy-sauce egg alongside the requisite braised peanuts and dark soy sauce. Ribs come in a completely different form when you order the BBQ Pork Ribs, a much more American affair glazed in sticky sweet and sour sauce, over a bed of crisp fries. Then there’s the Japanese Chashu Rice Set, think ramen turned into a rice dish, with sweet glazed chashu served with freshly steamed rice. For a little zi-char comfort, order the Frog Leg Hor Fun, smoky wok-fried rice noodles tossed up with tender frog legs, spring onions, and lots of fiery ginger in a rich soy-based sauce.

Once synonymous with every great soiree, punch was a main feature of opulent house parties in the 1960s. A very social and communal drink, it is now back in vogue. Punch is the drink of crossroads; of ships and ports, commerce and adventure. It started in the ports of India and the East Indies using native ingredients such as arrack, lime juice, palm sugar and spices, before becoming the first mixed spirits drink to become globally popular. Over the years, other ingredients such as London dry gin, sherry wine, fancy liqueurs, American rye whiskey, cold soda water have been incorporated into punch bowl recipes, making it one of the most exciting styles of mixed beverages. Republic is delighted to have worked with David Wondrich to shape our new punch bowl menu. A key figure driving the punch revival, Wondrich is one of the world's foremost authorities on the history of the cocktail and one of the founders of the modern craft cocktail movement. “There is no quicker way to bind a group of people together in friendship than to gather them around a bowl of real punch,” shares David. On Sundays, our newly launched Punch Brunch is a curated experience that features appetisers, a main course and dessert, complemented with our signature punches and cocktails. Select from starters such as the British prawn cocktail with brandy-prawn dressing; or foie gras terrine with port wine gelée and brioche; mains like the braised beef short rib with potato mousseline; or Hainanese Kurobuta pork chop; and finish with a mini warm chocolate pistachio tart with vanilla ice cream, or the raspberry yoghurt ball. Your dining experience is complemented with unlimited pours from Republic’s three punch bowls. Other cocktail options guests can enjoy include the Timeless Beauty, English Milk Punch, Ruby Bellini and Irish Coffee. Republic’s Punch Brunch is available on Sundays from 12 p.m. to 3 p.m. at $168++ per person.When: Every SundaysTime: 12-3pmPrice: $168++ per personClick here to view the menu.</p></li><li><h5>href</h5><p>https://www.chope.co/singapore-restaurants/restaurant/republic</p></li>","Republic","https://www.chope.co/singapore-restaurants/restaurant/republic",1

They have been one of Singapore’s most popular brunch spots since their establishment in 2007. Riders Café specializes in contemporary comfort food in a casual and relaxing space that exudes a lovely old-world charm in a black and white house. Guests are treated to a lovely view of riders on horses while dining at the cafe's verandah - a charming view where you might just forget you are in Singapore.

In the evening, the calming view of the setting sun along with the gorgeous pink hued sky is perfectly framed from the verandah of Riders Cafe. Just minutes away from the bustling city, this idyllic getaway is perfect for a romantic dinner or an intimate family gathering. Contrary to the buzzing brunch service they are so well known for, their dinner service is turned down to a chill and relaxing ambience, with a carefully curated selection of wines and full main courses. The Dinner Menu is a sampling of modern European cuisine with classic signatures such as the Steak Frites - 250gm Australian Angus Striploin (150 day grain fed), Berkshire Bone-In Grilled Pork Chop and Roasted Snapper.

Ristorante Da Valentino prides itself on its seasonally-influenced menu, working with the best produce of each season, bringing the harvest highlights to the table. Open a meal with some antipasti, like a Mediterranean-style grilled octopus leg, spritzed with the barest trace of lemon juice to highlight its oceany flavours. There’s also an appetizer of thinly-sliced pork loin blanketed in a zingy sauce of capers, mayonnaise, and tuna, the perfect prelude to hearty, seafood-studded pasta mains like black fettuccine dressed in fruity olive oil with chunks of crabmeat. If you still have room for a course after that, order some dry aged tenderloin served up with earthy porcini mushrooms and mashed potato, or some pork chops given a sweet moscato marinade for an extra tender, deeply-flavoured dish. Hearty from start to finish, with a rustic sensibility that’s so quintessentially Italian, you know you’re in the good hands of a family steeped in tradition at Ristorante Chef Valentino.

At its helm is Chef Masahiro Takada, who has established himself as a trailblazer and a creator of superb Japanese-Italian fare. With a strong emphasis on the freshness of ingredients used, Chef Takada ensures the extraordinary standard and quality of his food. The restaurant uses fresh seafood, such as Hokkaido scallops and sea urchin, which are imported directly from the famed Tsukiji market in Tokyo.
The squid ink taglioni topped with sea urchin is sublime, with the combination of ingredients releasing a delightful blend of flavours on the taste buds. We also highly recommend the Wagyu tenderloin steak which is cooked to perfection, bringing out the full magnificent texture of the beef. These are all found on the July 2016 dinner menu, and are just a few examples of Chef Takada’s varied and exquisitely unique creations.
Let your dining experience be elevated further by the simple, chic decor that speaks of subtle elegance. The soothing jazz music and minimalist aesthetic create a great ambience that complements the meal perfectly. Japanese-Italian cuisine might not be quite as well-known as Japanese-French fare, but we definitely recommend giving Ristorante Takada a go! (Jul 2016)

Ingredients are handpicked, pasta are homemade and cooked a la minute, and pizza are cooked to perfection in a wood-fired oven. In fact, the Chef Specialities vary each day depending on what owner, Marcus Edwin Wu, finds on his nightly journey to Jurong Port, where he selects the freshest seafood to serve.

""Chef Wu wasn't kidding about his insistence on using the best ingredients. From the milky and wonderfully creamy burrata from Puglia and the intensely flavourful 36-month aged parma ham, to the juicy home-cured Roma tomatoes, the a la carte menu of antipasti is easily one of the most impressive selection we've ever sampled, a, pun unintended, symphony of delightfully fresh flavours and contrasting textures.

""And for all its unlikely setting, a residential estate up near MacRitchie; a good proving ground built surely not a permanent recipe for success, relative newbie Rubato does a solid job on all fronts."" -SG Now
""It seems out of place in a row of run down eateries and hawker stalls, but don't let the neighbours fool you - this place serves a menu that holds it's own against some our city's most exclusive dining areas. We are almost a little sad to let this cat out of the bag, as we wanted to keep this bellissimo gem all to ourselves."" -The Honeycombers
""Young head chef Wu whips up comfort Italian food that seeks to appeal to groups of families or couples. Tagliatelle with porcini mushroom sauce or burratina cheese salad complements a quiet evening, while the rib-eye risotto is a satisfying stomach filler. Small fairy-light lamps hang above white tablecloths in this intimate setting in which tables are grouped closely together, making for a warm atmosphere."" -Time Out Singapore</p></li><li><h5>SAVE 10% WITH CHOPEDEALS</h5><p>Enjoy 10% off at RUBATO Italian Restaurant & Wine Bar @ Greenwood when you purchase vouchers from ChopeDeals.

Their freshly shucked oysters and Rubato's Foie Gras are another must try, chargrilled to perfection and melt-in-your-mouth creamy, it’s the perfect way to start an evening at Rubato. They pair amazingly with a robust glass of red wine. For mains, go for their “A Gift From The Angels” Angel Hair Pasta that features sweet Hokkaido scallops, japanese seaweed and is drizzled with white truffle oil. This luxurious dish is full of smokey flavour and delightfully appetising. For smaller portions, get this as an appetiser instead for more stomach room for more dishes. The massive Rubato's World-Famous Burger is another main course worth devouring. It comes with juicy patties on fluffy buns and crisp bacon, or you can try one of their freshly made hand-stretched pizzas. Say “More Cheese Please” for Rubato’s cheesiest pizza or go for “In Search For Wild Mushrooms” for a shroomy pizza that’s full of umami earthy flavours. To end off your meal, go for Rubato’s Granny Smith Apple Pie and Sorbet for a sweet and comforting end.

It makes sense that the décor isn’t overblown because, as the familiar quip goes, all the better to focus on the amazing, New Orleans-inspired food, my dears!

You might expect to come face-to-face with pages of meats once you crack open the menu, given its name, but, refreshingly enough, it starts off with plenty of seafood appetisers. Barbecued Shrimp, Sizzlin’ Jumbo Scallops, their signature Blue Crab Cakes; all good reminders that there’s more to this steak house than just beef. Go a little further, however, and you’ll strike gold: custom-aged Midwestern beef that come in all sorts of cuts, from Ribeye and Porterhouse to Petite Filet for those with a smaller appetite. Pair your juicy, perfectly grilled steaks – which come on a piping hot plate – with a Bleu Cheese Crust, get it Oscar Style with crab cakes, asparagus, and béarnaise sauce, or throw your diet plan out and add on other succulent mains such as Fresh Lobster or an Ahi-Tuna Stack. After all, when at Ruth’s Chris Steak House, following that wise rule of ‘go big or go home’ is what we call a solid plan.

True to Chef Drew’s personal cooking philosophy of Minimal Wastage, the menu encapsulates the essence of Sustainable Cooking where every part of a single produce is pushed to its maximum potential.Diners are transported to a utopia of Sustainable Cuisine, starting from the table setting with a cutlery holder made from recycled abalone shells; to a pictorial guide detailing how each by-product are used, and lastly, the fine flavours from Chef Drew’s enthralling take on sustainable cooking.
Drew grew up on his family farm near Brisbane, Australia where it first ignited his passion for cooking. He spent most of his childhood working the farm and attributes his cooking style and philosophy to his time at the farm. Coupled with hard work, passion, and dedication to his craft, Drew’s personal cooking philosophy of Minimal Wastage forms the cornerstone of Salted & Hung.
The 7 & 10 course menu showcases Chef Drew’s clever manoeuvre of ingredients and his vision for a Sustainable kitchen.
The signature dish on the menu is the Aged Turbot served on a wooden board with three elements, namely the ‘Turbot’, ‘Turbot Tea Broth’ and ‘Turbot Liver Vin Jaune’ sauce. The 5-days aged Turbot is stuffed with Mushroom Duxelles that has been slow-cooked for 8 hours. The skin and turbot trimmings will be fermented into a garam that is later used to season the fish. The dish is then finished off with a sauce made from the Turbot liver and Vin Jaune. Lastly, the turbot bones are hung and dried for 14 days in preparation for its role in making a dashi broth, along with local herbs and flowers lending an aromatic flavour to the dashi tea. These three elements will come together when presented tableside by our server.
Next, the Kagoshima A4 Wagyu presents a sirloin steak grilled over Japanese Bincho-tan paired with carrots. The carrots presented on the dish are prepared in a process that spans over 24 hours. First, the carrots are confit in excess beef fat from the Wagyu, then slow-cooked, dried and rehydrated with beef sauce. The rest of the carrot trimmings goes into making a smoked carrot ketchup. Lastly, the sauces finishing touches consists of a charcoal powder derived from onion and leek trimmings, and pear and shiitake mushroom reduction made from vegetable trimmings.
The final pièce de resistance El Toro Orchard is Chef Drew’s tribute to his family farm in Stanthorpe, Queensland. The farm is founded in 1945 and tended by generations of the Nocente family. The orchard mainly bears Granny Smith apples, Gala apples and Red Delicious apples. The dessert presents an Apple Tartin that resembles an apple dropped on the Orchard ground. The Apple Tartin is caramelised and compressed with cider, and filled with apple jam. The dessert is paired with chocolate twigs and mascarpone ice-cream.

The star of this restaurant is the laksa soup -- a rich and spicy concoction that comes with an extra bowl of laksa leaves for you to add as you wish. While it’s tempting to slurp up the gravy on its own, San Laksa Steamboat offers a wide variety of fresh seafood, vegetables, and meat for you to amp up your hot pot experience.Start with local vegetables such as kang kong, Chinese lettuce, and a mixed platter of mushrooms to infuse sweetness into the soup. Love cheese? The cheese tofu is a popular item here, where a square of fermented beancurd hides a lovely, cheesy middle. And no laksa soup can be complete without an order of tau pok — the spongy beancurd skin is the perfect way to sop up all the richness of the laksa broth.For meats, try the fresh prawns or wafer-thin slices of pork collar. Diners who prefer more seafood in their hot pot can opt for the fresh toman fillet. Round up a scrumptious dinner experience with an order of handmade minced meatballs, laced with tiny bits of water chestnut for that added crunch.

Perfect for families, or anyone on the beach looking to tuck into its selection of generous Western plates and cocktails.
Think meaty sharing plates straight off the kitchen’s nifty charcoal grill, like a crisp-skinned charcoal-grilled chicken leg, or pleasantly charred US Black Angus Ribeye with roasted whole garlic, caramelized onions, and sweet pommery mustard. If in doubt, opt for a platter, like the Grilled Sausage Platter featuring chorizo, Italian sausages, and beef sausages with gherkins and zingy mustard. The signature SandBank Fish & Chips, made with battered seabass and served with fries and homemade Asian-inspired tartare sauce, makes the perfect beach-side lunch. If it’s a group situation, grab a few pizzas and spoil yourselves with flavours like the BBQ Pulled Pork, which sees chewy dough topped with a tangy and savoury shreds of pork, onions, and pineapples, and the elegant Verdura, a vegetarian number strewn with artichokes, mushroom, pimento, and spinach. On top of all this, look out for its sumptuous international breakfast and brunch buffet on weekends!

What's more, given that most dishes are grilled, baked, or sautéed in olive oil, you don't have to worry about overindulging.
Their cosy home in one of Singapore's oldest, and most vibrant, cultural neighbourhoods, makes complete sense given their desire to impress with traditional flavours with a touch of modern flair. The al fresco area is perfect for people-spotting, and paves the way for a picturesque meal given the backdrop of one of Singapore's most ornate religious structures, the Sultan Mosque.

Visitors are especially fond of its sandwiches on weekdays, which is no surprise considering the name ‘Sarnies’ is a slang term for sandwich! Little jokes aside though, Sarnies has proven to have as much substance as it has style, and that’s saying quite a bit; the café has received nominations by City Nomads for Best Coffee Roasters and Best Value Restaurant in Singapore, and has been featured in the Singapore Lonely Planet Guide. That’s gotta mean something!
Looking past the accolades straight to the food and drink, coffee addicts will fall in love with the quality brews served here. With coffee beans that are meticulously roasted by a team of talented baristas, and with all coffees made with a double ristretto for more intense flavour, Sarnies firmly establishes itself as the place to go for your caffeine fix. And as for the food, you definitely wouldn’t go wrong with the brunch options, but the dinner menu offers a plethora of mouthwatering delights.

With a menu bursting with authentic, affordable classics and plenty of tipples to go with your meal, this is the perfect spot for dinner and drinks with friends.
While all the pastas here are done well, the Penne Alla Carbonara deserves special mention for seamlessly blending pecorino cheese and egg yolk into a creamy mixture that is flavourful without being too rich. The pizzas are large enough for sharing, and the Margherita is one of our favourites. Made with fresh mozzarella and basil, the dish is deliciously simple and goes perfectly with a glass of Premium Red from the drinks menu.
Seafood lovers will appreciate the Zuppa Di Cozze, fresh black mussels in a white wine sauce. The sauce is light and luscious, and goes well with the succulent meat from the mussels. Mop up the remaining sauce with the oven toasted bread that the dish is served with. For a sweet end to the meal, dig into the Tiramisu. Soft savoiardi and creamy Italian mascarpone are the centerpieces of this treat.
Whether you’re new to Italian cuisine or a seasoned expert, you’ll feel welcome in this friendly restaurant.

Fun fact: Seoul Garden remains one of the few Korean barbeque restaurants that’s Halal-certified, and continues to prioritise a pro-family dining environment with a complimentary kids buffet on Sundays, and concessions for senior citizens.

Tuck into contemporary Korean seafood dishes such as the Modern Korean Paella, where hearty amounts of flavourful mussels, prawns, squids, and clams are piled onto a bed of white rice, which seals in all the seafood’s goodness.

The Chilli Crab with Man Tou is a must-try. Based on the hawker classic, Sessions’ rendition is made with fresh crab and features a thick gravy flavoured with red chilli and plenty of tomato sauce for a well-rounded taste. Go in with your hands and mop up excess gravy with the delightfully fluffy Man Tou buns. Another usual hawker suspect is the Cereal Crayfish. An exquisite take on Cereal Prawn, this dish features the larger and juicier crayfish rolled in butter cereal and deep fried to golden perfection. 

There is also a range of delicious vegetable dishes on offer for diners who wish to enjoy a ‘zi-char’ style meal. The Stir-Fried Belachan Kang Kong gets our vote as it is cooked to tender perfection. The belachan gives the dish some heat and salty flavour, and it goes well with a bowl of steamed rice. (March 2019)

Nestled in a corner of Robertson Quay along a well-trodden path, Shabestan offers classic Persian cuisine but with a decisive nod to local palettes: less grease yet still perfumed with exotic, but never overwhelming, spices.

That Shabestan's Executive Chef Hamid Hosseini obsession with fine ingredients is apparent - there is nothing artificial in the flavours that combine to make each dish. Traditional grilled meats are marinated in fresh herbs; while seasonal vegetables meld with spices so perfectly that your taste buds will thank you for the experience.
A little birdie tells us that Middle Eastern royalty have dined here on more than one occasion. We believe it - the food is wholesome perfection. Juxtaposed against the nightly belly dancing show, dining here embodies a delightful blend of naughty and nice. (Jan 2019)</p></li><li><h5>THE BUZZ</h5><p>

The Signature Honey Pork Belly is one of their most popular items, and for good reason. The meat is deliciously juicy, and is enhanced by the sweet smokiness of the marinade and grill. The skin of the pork belly is delightfully crisp, but the meat inside is melt-in-your-mouth tender. There is also a wide variety of seafood items. The Sichuan Kung Pao Prawn is made with a generous portion of spice for that mouth-numbing spice that Singaporeans have come to love.

The endearingly twee vibe here harkens back to a day of refinement, when going out for a meal was a special occasion, and where personal, friendly service was a big part of the meal. But at Shashlik, it's also the comforting flavours that have kept customers returning over the years, starting with the pillowy dinner rolls and butter that greet you at the table, and following through to entrees like French Onion Soup, a meaty beef broth enriched with caramelized onions and a crusty cheese croute, or endearingly 60s appetizers like Egg Millionaire - chopped boiled egg, bacon bits, and parmesan gratin served in little egg cups. There's even Blinis & Caviar, served with sour cream, if you're feeling especially indulgent before your main.
We'd hold back on the appetizers though, because the shashlik, or meat grilled on skewers served straight up at the table, is very hearty. There's the classic Shashlik of Beef, juicy tenderloin rich with the flavours of a 24-hour marinade, as well as pork, chicken, and lamb. If you like your meat cooked more conventionally, there's also grilled steaks. But one of our favourite ways of eating meat here is in one of Shashlik's classic old-world stews: hearty, rustic Oxtail Stew and creamy Beef Stroganoff, perfect with some crusty bread or rice, and a heart full of nostalgia. For dessert: Baked Alaska, no question.
The food here may seem a little too quaint for the 21st century, but really that's part of the charm, and a rapidly disappearing one at that. So book a table while you can!

The table-side acrobatics of its Japan-trained chefs has become a part of the meal as the delicious flash-cooked dishes made from fresh ingredients. The menu has since expanded to include sushi and sashimi dishes to go along with the hot plates, satisfying that Japanese cuisine craving of yours under one roof.
The classic Teppanyaki menu features a range of premium meats cooked before your eyes to perfection. Fatty tenderloin of Wagyu, chicken thigh, buttery foie gras, live lobster, and tender salmon belly sizzle on the pan, releasing their delicious aromas as a teaser to the meal. Mounds of garlicky fried rice and fresh vegetables follow, mopping up the meaty juices for a taste of perfection. If you want to beef up your meal, order some hand rolls that are studded with everything from chopped tuna belly to braised unagi, or get a platter of sashimi to ramp up all those umami flavours swirling about in your mouth. If you hate choosing, meals here come in elegant Kaiseki-style sets, where you let the chefs prepare the meal at a luxurious pace that will leave you bursting at the seams. Everyone loves a good, smoky teppanyaki dinner, and here you get to pair that with sushi for a complete Japanese night out!

Chef Tan takes great pride in making sure he maintains an intimate setting in his sushi bar. He wants every seat in the house to be the best so that guests have full view of their personal chefs in working on their creations.

At Shinzo, one can expect nothing less than the freshest ingredients flown in directly from Japan. Just as the ingredients varies with the seasons in Japan, so does Shinzo’s menu.

It is the product of a proud culinary legacy that began with the founding of Japan’s first Szechwan restaurant in 1958 by Chen Kenmin, regarded as the “Father of Szechwan cuisine in Japan.” Carrying on the family tradition is his eldest son, Chen Kenichi, nicknamed the “Szechwan Sage” and acclaimed as one of Japan’s most celebrated iron chefs. It was Chen Kenichi that expanded the family business, branching out across Japan and imbuing his personal touch to the Shisen Hanten brand by incorporating fresh new ideas into the menu offerings. Now taking center stage is third-generation Chen Kentaro, Executive Chef of Shisen Hanten by Chen Kentaro, and himself a rising star in Japan’s culinary scene. From the time the restaurant was launched in 2014, Chef Kentaro continues to demonstrate his mastery of Szechwan cuisine with a menu that celebrates the signature flavors of Shisen Hanten, alongside traditional Cantonese fare. Shisen Hanten by Chen Kentaro was awarded two stars in the MICHELIN Guide Singapore 2016, 2017 and 2018, 2019, 2021, making it the highest Michelin-rated Chinese restaurant in Singapore for five consecutive years.

Perhaps, 'joint' isn't the right word; after all, a restaurant which boasts an austere elegance and a pricey omakase menu deserves more formality. It's a venture with the founder of three Michelin star Sushi Shikon - folks who've been to this Mercer Hotel establishment in Hong Kong will likely remember its jaw-dropping price tag - so excellent Japanese food is to be expected.
Like most Japanese places which take pride in authenticity, ingredients are flown in from Tsukiji Market daily and used to great effect in the Master Chef's impressive array of omakase dishes. Let's just say that wobbling out of Shoukouwa is a possibility once you've finished two appetisers, three assorted sashimi, four cooked dishes, 13 pieces of nigiri sushi, miso soup, Japanese omelette, and dessert. The cooked dishes are great but the stars of the show are, without a doubt, the premium seafood. Slices bear none of that heavy, fishy aroma, but remain slightly salty and very sweet - as all fresh catch should be. If you're looking to be hypnotised by a vast array of dishes made in front of your eyes and impeccably fresh seafood, look no further than this incredibly intimate and meditative sushi restaurant.

Established in 2004, the flagship restaurant has been delighting diners with Sichuan classics for over a decade. The dishes here combine a variety of cuisines - from Huaiying to Cantonese, with dishes ranging from spicy Pepper Chicken to soothing soups.

The popular Mala Hotpot has its roots in Sichuan cuisine, so it’s no surprise that dishes on the menu come with an extra kick. Spice fanatics will love the Mala Crab for its searing heat levels and generous portions of crab meat. Diners who prefer something less fiery can opt for the delicious Chicken Pudding - a delectable dish of meat and herbs that is perfect on a cold day. The Marinated Pig’s Trotter is another Sichuan dish that features tender pork meat soaked in a flavourful blend of herbs and spices and cooked to perfection.

The premium ingredients and fancy interior may seem too plush for some, but don’t be fooled - this restaurant is as wallet-friendly as it gets, so patrons can indulge without fear of breaking the bank.

Staying true to their conviction of serving only high quality food, ingredients are sourced from leading Japanese suppliers and air-flown in fresh from Japan.

For the more adventurous, the Yaki Gyu Tan, where premium beef tongue is grilled to tender perfection is sure to please as well.

Shunjuu Izakaya, situated along the beautiful Robertson Quay, adds a refreshing spritz of excitement to the modern Izakaya with their specialty in Sumiyaki, charcoal-grilled dishes which may very well be the Japanese answer to tapas.

We love the al-fresco dining space but if you’re looking for some air-conditioned comfort, the wood-filled interior and cosy booths provides a much-welcomed respite. When it comes to food, expect well-executed Japanese favourites with an emphasis on dishes that pair well with sake or shochu. As with tapas, the dishes are served as small plates made for sharing, so don’t go easy on the ordering! All 70 of their sumiyaki signatures such as the Tori Kawa Ninniku (garlic rolled with chicken skin), Tebasaki (chicken wings), Gyu Tan (ox tongue) are not to be missed of course. Cold dishes such as the Tako Wasabi (seasoned baby octopus) , the Sashimi Sarada (sashimi salad), and Tori Kawa Masago Ae (chicken skin mixed with cod roe) are also as delicious as hot plates such as the Buta Kimuchi Itame (stir-fry pork and kimchee) and the Ribuai Tataki (ribeye carparccio).

For some carbs, opt for some Soba or the delicious Ninniku Cha-han (garlic fried rice). Wash it all down with sake or shochu - a wide selection awaits, along with a detailed table which specifies the serving temperature, the prefecture of origin, and the sake meter, allowing you to make the most informed choice. We suggest you try a few. It can’t hurt, can it? (Aug 2018)</p></li><li><h5>THE BUZZ</h5><p>“Shunjuu Izakaya grills the competition, pun intended, with their sumiyaki (charcoal grill) specialties.

The restaurant's management staff replied, ""Sichuan spicy!"" Normally we would discount that reply as pure marketing trickery, but after trying the dishes for ourselves, we were instant believers.
Welcome to Si Chuan Dou Hua, bringing you authentic Sichuan and Cantonese cuisine from its perch on the top floor of UOB Plaza 1. Complete with chefs imported in from Sichuan and Hong Kong in addition to martial arts-and-dance-trained traditional tea pourers from Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province, this place is as real as it gets, folks!
Although there are three outlets in Singapore, each boasting a different menu that caters to a specific clientele, the UOB location is best known for its 30% Sichuan and 70% Cantonese split menu. This makes it ideal for hosting clients since it's probably best to avoid the faux pas of entertaining guests while drenched in a fearsome chili-induced sweat.
In addition to abalone-themed set meals and Sichuan-style high tea, the restaurant also features an expansive list of high end teas imported from various regions in China.

Whether it is a tucking into a bubbling pot of fish head curry, or scouring for the best sambal for our nasi lemak, we flock to spicy foods like moths to a flame. That’s why we’re head over heels for Si Wei Mao Cai, a humble Sichuan restaurant located in Chinatown that reigns supreme with its fiendishly spicy foods. 

Ready to set your tongue ablaze? Then we highly recommend diving into a pot of Si Wei Stewed Beef in Hot Szechuan Pepper Sauce. Adventurous eaters should not miss the restaurant’s rendition of Si Wei Chilli Frog where tender frog legs are stir-fried in a blend of fresh and dried chillies. Then wash down the spiciness with the mild vinegary Pickled Vegetables with Beef, or any number of Chinese wines and liquors available here. If you ask us, we personally can’t say no to a cold glass of Hai Zi Lan or a Mao Tai. 

Aside from its delectable dishes, Si Wei Mao Cai also prides itself on its top-notch service. And honestly, we’re bowled over not only by the incredibly polite and efficient wait staff, but the kitchen who tries to accommodate any requests for Sichuan dishes not on the menu.

Sichuan Alley focuses wholeheartedly on one particular Sichuan ingredient known as Mian Yang rice noodles. At Sichuan Alley, these noodles are served the way they have always been for millennia: with a choice of different broths, and a variety of toppings such as braised beef and pig intestines.
Sichuan Alley’s rice noodles are, admittedly, a little more distinctive: they are specially sourced from one particular artisan who lives in a village deep in Sichuan. Research for months into about 50 different Sichuan noodle shops led the Sichuan Alley team to understand that only one particular shop sold the exact type and style of Mian Yang noodles that they wanted to present to Singaporeans – but it took close to a year and dozens of personal trips to the shop insincere appeal before the owners finally softened and agreed to speak to them. It took even longer to research and try the different noodles the artisan-made: every detail was examined, down to the gauge of the noodles in millimeters.The noodles now served in Sichuan Alley are customised for the noodle house and found nowhere else in Singapore or South East Asia. The noodles may be ordered with the clear or red soups as well as the uniquely Sichuan mix of red and clear. In addition, Sichuan Alley also offers a third broth option: a deceptively clear soup that is piquantly infused with Sichuan vine pepper, and a dry-tossed version. Those with bigger appetites can feel free to order “add-ons” as extra toppings for the noodles, and a curated selection of small plates – archetypal Sichuan sides such as Fried Crispy Pig Intestines and Braised Eggplant – as accompaniment.
The interiors of Sichuan Alley is deserving of attention from the diner as well. Located in a side alley just off the far busier main street in much the same way that noodle shops in China have been set up for years, Sichuan Alley is a little haven of gently coloured wood, bamboo furnishings and warm lighting. The small space of half a dozen tables – bustling when full, and tranquil when quiet – is inspired by the aforementioned noodle shops though elevated with thoughtful design details to ensure comfort for the guest even at the busiest of times.

Roasted for an optimum amount of time so that the premium duck meat can retain moisture and succulence under its layers of shining, cracking, skin, diners are free to enjoy this in the usual way (rolled in a crepe), or with sugar granules that bring out its crunchiness and crispiness even more. A meal at Silk Road Restaurant is almost akin to a journey of discovery down the Silk Road - definitely not to be missed!

Surrounded by lush greenery and the splendid views of the iconic River Valley and Robertson Quay area, the restaurant dishes up classic bistro fare that complements its bar menu.

From adding bone marrow to mushroom cream pasta to smoking the highest quality Duroc bacon for the restaurant’s salads, pastas and pizzas, Sky Lido uses only the most delicious and sustainable produce sourced from local farms and kelongs. 

Classic dishes are reimagined to bring diners maximum flavour and satisfaction. Fit for two, the Grilled Vegetable Plate is a tasty mix of greens made up of grilled veggie favourites such as purple cabbage, zucchini and eggplant topped with toasted almonds for an extra crunch! Truffle Fries and Shiitake Kombu Corn are classic starters diners can look forward to starting their meal with. 

Served with a hearty side of french fries, the Sky Lido Cheeseburger is a well-loved staple that features a seared aged Argentinian beef patty sandwiched between layers of cheddar, bacon onion jam, balsamic ketchup and fresh lettuce. Other signature must-have favourites include the Brandy Cream Seafood, Burnt Butter Sea Bass and Pepperoni Pizza.

This laidback and tranquil eating joint, located on the 22nd floor of the Peninsula Excelsior Hotel, touts some of the best city views around with stunning 270-degree views of the city skyline and Marina Bay waterfront area.

Simplicity and timelessness is the driving motto at this immaculately polished establishment. This is immediately apparent from the second you step through its doors as you set your eyes on the restaurant’s elegant and tailored decor. Then tuck into a worldly feast, with an international menu that will unmistakably satisfy curious diners. We love kicking the meal off with a zesty Scallop Salad made better with the addition of oranges, strawberries, cherry tomatoes on a bed of lettuce and baby spinach. Meat-lovers can partake in some quality meats, with well-crafted mains such as the Five Spice Lamb Rack where lamb marinated in Chinese spices is cleverly paired with a smoky barbecue sauce. Equally admirable is the Asian fare, with standouts such as the delectable and creamy Thai Red Curry Chicken. And be sure to save room for a sweet treat. We recommend the citrusy Cheese Cake drizzled with a sour cherry coulis. 

By elevating gourmet food to a new level, Sky Lounge shines with its amazing fare and breathtaking city views.

And at Smokey's BBQ, the down to earth, open air, go-to place for American-style ribs, that's exactly what you get. This isn't your simple poolside open brick pit with charcoal. In fact, Smokey's use a custom built smoker, imported wood from the States, and a homemade dry rub, all for that ultimate barbecue experience. Endorsed by our very own in-house token Texan, Smokey's BBQ is THE place to go for delicious ribs, beer, and an old-fashioned good time.
The homemade sauces complement the dishes perfectly, and when coupled with the rich smoky flavour of the meat, it's impossible to resist picking the bones clean. For the perfect barbecue experience though, you'll need to wash all that meat down with some ice cold beer! There's beer on tap, imported craft beers by the bottle, and even a selection of wines from the walk-in wine cellar. Suffice to say, you won't be leaving hungry or thirsty.
As one of the owners so eloquently said, the secret to Smokey's is simply that they love the food they serve, and serve the food they love.

Quality and authentic Turkish food at amazing prices isn’t easy to find but Sofra Turkish Cafe & Restaurant manages to tick off these boxes effortlessly.
Sofra, which means “let’s dine” in Turkish, stays true to the humility, warmth and joy of sharing a meal. The fuss-free decor, riddled with interesting trinkets and folksy furniture puts all the attention on the good food while the extensive menu doesn’t dilute the quality of each Turkish classic.
Try their pide, a Turkish pizza filled with gooey cheese and your choice of meat, or the indispensable Sofra Kebap, where your freshly baked bread is heaped with generous servings of meat, walnut, tomato and cheese. The Turkish answer to meatballs, Izgara Kofte, is also a timeless crowd favourite. Wash down the food with a cup of Turkish Hot Apple Tea or Turkish Coffee to complete the Turkish experience.
If you’re around the area, do check out their set lunches, an absolute steal with prices ranging from $7.90 to $14.90 nett. Wait no longer! (Jul 2016)</p></li><li><h5>THE BUZZ</h5><p>“This is one restaurant that doesn't need special introducing. Sofra probably serves every Turkish dish you can think of, but some of the crowd favourites you should definitely try are the Mussaka, Adana Kebab (served on a sword), and Izgara kofte!” -SoShiok
“Relax and sip a cup of comforting Turkish tea at this laid-back niche while you wait for your lahmacun (Turkish ‘pizza’ with a minced meat and vegetable topping). Spicy and tangy at once, it is goodly-sized to satisfy a lunch appetite.” -Wine & Dine Magazine
“Always a crowd favourite, Sofra has a food menu that’s pretty extensive. If you need help deciding what to order, the adana kebab, musakka, and pide are fab choices. Need a nice little pick-me-up? Order a cup of super potent Turkish coffee.” -Honeycombers</p></li><li><h5>DISHES WE LOVE</h5><p>Hummus, Sofra Kebap, Pide, Sofra Musakka, Izgara Kofte, Hunkar Begendi,  Turkish Coffee, Turkish Hot Apple Tea, Baklava</p></li><li><h5>href</h5><p>https://www.chope.co/singapore-restaurants/restaurant/sofra-turkish-cafe-restaurant</p></li>","Sofra Turkish Cafe & Restaurant","https://www.chope.co/singapore-restaurants/restaurant/sofra-turkish-cafe-restaurant",1

Spicy House Restaurant certainly pulls no punches in serving quality, fiercely authentic, Chengdu-style hotpot. The chain has its origins in Shanghai and the outlet in Riverside Point is its first overseas branch; unique to the Singapore outlet is the mouthwatering addition of Japanese wagyu beef and Australian lobster (plus some others) to the menu.

The restaurant’s signature soup base is the Mala Butter, which has a distinctively rich flavour courtesy of the butter stirred into the soup. You’d be hard-pressed to forget the taste of this particular base, which possesses a complexity that not many other places can produce. If you’re looking for something different, however, you can choose from a list of soup bases such as Tomato, Pig’s Trotters, and Chestnut Healthy Chicken, among others. Some ready-to-eat side dishes include flavourful Sichuan Dumplings as well as Mala Noodles, for those who feel like having something apart from hotpot. It quickly becomes apparent that there’s something in this restaurant for everyone,  especially for those who like their food extra spicy, so make your way down to Spicy House Restaurant – you definitely won’t regret it!

About Executive Chef Lee Boon Seng

As a boy of 17 in the kitchen of Equinox watching culinary virtuosity in action, executive chef Lee Boon Seng found his
calling. He stayed for eight years at this - his first job, rising from trainee to Chef de Partie before notching an impressive resume at places like Curate and the one-starred Osia at Resorts World Sentosa.

Chef Lee was honored with multiple accolades including Rising Chef of the Year at the World Gourmet Summit of 2013, and the Overall Champion during the semi-finals of Global Chefs Challenge organized by the Paris-based World Association of Chefs Societies (WACS). He also earned the opportunity of hosting and working with numerous Michelin-starred veterans such as Massimiliano Alajmo of the three-starred Le Calandre in Padua, Italy; Guy Martin of the three-starred Le Grand Véfour in Paris, France; and Esben Holmboe Bang of the three-starred Maaemo in Oslo, Norway.

The food at The Spot is highly individualistic – with the starting point an ingredient that excites Chef Lee with the drive to introduce its beauty to the world by elevating its flavors. He found this route through sauces, employing the European techniques of his training in tandem with the Southeast Asian fruits, herbs, and spices of his cultural heritage.

Opened in 1929, the establishment has seen more than one venue (think the well-known Great World Amusement Park), and today one can find it located in a beautifully preserved heritage shophouse along Upper Cross Street. A restaurant that has remained open for this long surely has something good going for it, and you certainly won’t regret a visit!

Lose yourself in the variety of sets offered on the menu. There’s a particular set for one person that we’re pretty fond of, with its plethora of seafood eats. Luxuriate in a serving of Stewed Boston Lobster in Fresh Fungus in Superior Stock, a tasty dish made with delightfully fresh helpings of lobster you’ll be remembering for days to come. The Crisp Fried Fillet of Cod Fish with BBQ Sauce is another dish that’s easy to love – perfectly crispy on the outside with firm, fresh cod on the inside, you’d be hard-pressed to stop yourself from guzzling it all down in a rush! There are other sets available that are pretty damn good too, and anyone who gets a taste of the restaurant’s comfort food offerings will immediately understand why it has remained open for business through the decades.

The menu here is dedicated to authentic Swabian classics such as Pork Knuckle, Speciality Sausages, and Spatzle. Whether you’re a newbie to German cuisine or a seasoned connoisseur, there’s sure to be something for you. With fine upholstery, lively music, and welcoming staff, Bavaria is just but a meal away. 

You can’t go wrong with the Pork Knuckle. Crisp on the outside, yet tender and juicy on the inside, this dish is amazingly tasty. Pair it with one of the beers imported straight from Stuttgart and you’ll get a truly authentic Swabian feast. There is also a wide selection of wines for diners who prefer alternatives. The Speciality Sausages are another hot favourite, and for good reason. Choose between beef, chicken, or pork sausages, which are dressed up with a side of mashed potatoes and gravy. The gravy is lightly spicy and adds flavour to the generous portion of sausages. The Chicken Spatzle with White Wine Sauce is a boozy dish that is perfect for ravenous diners looking for a decadent dish. (Mar 2019)

Large and shiny, it produces skewer after skewer of succulent meat grilled expertly right in front of you. Sumire hails from a long tradition of yakitori in Japan, and this is clear in its extensive menu, which showcases different parts of the humble chicken, from its shoulder to its thigh. Sumire’s meatballs are very popular for their savory balance of juicy flavours. They literally explode their goodness with each bite, making it necessary for you to reach out for a napkin or two to dab your mouth with after each bite. 
 
Non-yakitori items are also available at Sumire. The Japanese Daisen Chicken Hotpot is made from Daisen chicken, a breed of chicken that has been raised on the Daisen mountain in Tottori Prefecture (north of Kyoto) in Japan. The stock itself is chock-full of goodness, with chicken meat, minced chicken balls, prawn, fried tofu, enoki mushrooms, okra, zucchini, and fungus all contributing to its robust and hearty flavour.
 
Love runny eggs? The D-I-Y Tamago Toji Hotplate is the perfect dish for you. Tossed in the hotplate are grilled chicken meat, grilled chicken meatballs, and mixed mushrooms, all mixed in a savoury-sweet dashi. Unlike the usual Tamago Toji dishes, Sumire serves the raw pasteurized egg separately so you can decide how cooked you want your egg to be. Do not ignore the accompanying rice bowl topped with Egg Tempura. The yolk itself is comfortingly runny, and together with the chicken pieces hidden in the rice, it is an eggy party in the mouth. For a yakitori night out that is far from yucky, Sumire is the place for you.

Amidst the hilly greenery of the surrounding landscape, there's a high chance that you'll forget you're in Singapore, though the food and drinks here, created by a team led by Chef Chris Millar, will remind you that you're in one of the world's great dining cities.
Crafted in partnership with farming communities in Singapore and farther afield, and topped off with produce from an on-site organic garden, this is a gourmet restaurant with a heart for nature. Leveraging on Singapore's constant sunshine to create the feeling of eternal summer, flowers and herbs from the garden are used to adorn the plate and each mouthful bursts with sun-ripened, sustainably-sourced flavours.
Kelong-farmed grouper is served with an elegant pesto of farm-fresh carrot, orange-kissed hollandaise, and a garnish of garden nasturtiums. Seasonal farmed sea urchins from France are turned into a gelato-like ice cream, flavoured with soy sauce and topped with briny ikura and toasted nori, while beautiful Australian Mayura beef is rendered smoky and tender with an Inka grill before being served up with pickled pumpkin, local mushrooms, and an earl-grey infused jus.

3 years ago, we started our journey stemming from a fervent respect and desire to share the rich heritage of “edomae” sushi. The name symbolised a fresh start with immense possibilities and was the inspiration of our longtime and dear friend, highly acclaimed Chef Masakazu Ishibashi, affectionately known as “Chef Masa” by his followers in Japan and Asia.

Today, we are extremely privileged and humbled to announce a new chapter and the continuation of our dream with the official rebrand to Sushi Ayumu by Masa Ishibashi.

This will be Chef Masa’s second outpost outside of Tokyo, following his successful “Sushi Nanami by Masa Ishibashi” in Taipei.

Chef Masa comes from a family which ran a sushi restaurant in Tochigi prefecture and spent a lot of time behind the counter growing up. Many of his followers would have known him as the Executive Chef for Ginza Sushi Ichi Tokyo, Jakarta, Bangkok and Singapore. He led its Singapore branch to Michelin 1-star before starting Shoukouwa where he led them as the first “sushiya” in Singapore to earn Michelin 2-stars in their first 2 years of business. In Nov 2017, he returned to Tokyo with his wife Tomomi to establish Sushi Masa Ishibashi at Ginza, where he has become the latest culinary sensation at the heart of Tokyo’s high end dining scene.

Known for his precision and finesse, Chef Masa will impart his eye for details and dynamism with us through this rebrand. Together, we will start walking towards a new dream to reflect his vision and interpretation of the perfect sushi “omakase” indulgence, along with our renowned “omotenashi” in a calm and luxurious intimate setting. We welcome you to embark on a memorable and decadent dining journey with us at “Sushi Ayumu by Masa Ishibashi”. Looking forward to the pleasure of your next visit very soon.

The first of its kind in Singapore, the Japanese inspired, dual-concept offers a place for discerning guests to experience new level of hospitality and luxury. 

Located in Clarke Quay, Sushi Ichizuke will offer distinct experiences highlighting the very best of Japanese cuisine and culture with an Omakase Sushi-ya and a cocktail driven bar concept. 
With travel off the cards for the foreseeable future, Zouk’s latest venture provides an element of escapism to the former glory days of Tokyo and the hospitality of the Oiran, a category of the high ranking courtesan in Japanese history. The sophisticated décor incorporates bold and creative elements, providing an immersive experience that boast an intimate and modern yet traditional feel.

“During these uncertain times, we continually strive to provide our guests with refreshed and unique experiences, and look forward to providing an exceptional, one of a kind affair in Singapore with the launch of our latest concept,” said Andrew Li, CEO of Zouk Group.

Helmed by Head Chef Ryoichi Nakatani, Sushi Ichizuke reflects the traditional tea houses of Tokyo, which were the centre of entertainment and where friends would gather to relax and unwind with quality food, drinks and service. It exemplifies the finest hospitality and meticulous treatment toward all guests that was provided by the Oirans, and the vibrant atmosphere of friends gathering to relax and unwind with exceptional food, drinks and service in the traditional tea houses of Tokyo. The space boasts a central kitchen with a unique omakase seating where it completely surrounds the Chef with a 360 degree view, allowing guests to have an open view of the chef in works. The layout of the omakase bar is actually modelled after the iconic Zouk eye offering an omakase Sushi-ya with a modern yet traditional feel.

The menu comprises the freshest, high-quality ingredients flown in three times a week from Toyosu Fish Market in Tokyo. Paired with a curated music programme, the stylish and sophisticated Sushi Ichizuke takes a very Zouk approach to classic, offering a great, energetic environment and elevated vibe-dining experience.

With that said, a meal at Sushi Mieda is nothing short of breathtaking. Though what's served will change depending on what's in season in Japan at the current moment, you can be rest assured that everything will be prepared with craft and precision, earning Sushi Mieda a place among the upper crust of the best sushi restaurants in Singapore.
For our meal, we were welcomed with a starter of sea urchin atop sesame tofu, covered in a bonito-broth jelly, and garnished with a touch of caviar and gold leaf. Describing the combination of flavours and textures as a symphony probably doesn't do it justice; the balance of saltiness from the bonito jelly and sweetness from the sea urchin and sesame tofu meant it was more a masterpiece than any 'mere' composition.
Course after course convinced us that we were dining in the presence of a master craftsman. Head Chef Keisuke Ohno treated us to a dazzling array of fish both expected and uncommon. For the less sushi-seasoned, opportunities to sample fishes like golden-eyed snapper and black-throat perch will open your mind to an ocean far beyond salmon, tuna, and flounder.
The setting for this culinary master class is equally authentic. Seats at the sushi counter of eight make for an intimate dining experience, its position at the centre of the floor just emphasizing the exclusivity, while sitting at the ""outside"" tables lining the interior of the tower provide for spectacular views of the surrounding area.
Quite frankly, any meal at Sushi Mieda lets you leave the trappings of Collyer Quay far behind. An effortlessly bona fide Japanese experience, don't be surprised if you stumble back out, sated and blissful, and find yourself disorientated by the realization that you aren't standing on a street in Ginza.

</p></li><li><h5>ABOUT</h5><p>Dim Sum is food close to every Singaporean soul. Whether it’s fancy dim sum for Sunday brunch, humble dim sum for that post-party refuel, or the classic dim sum breakfast, dim sum always hits the spot.
When you’re a dim sum establishment that has been around for more than 50 years (yes, that’s as old as Singapore) but only opens from 6pm to 6am, then you know you’ve got your niche market down pat. Night owls swear by their Mee Suah Kueh, Prawn and Banana Fritters, and the Salted Egg Yolk Custard Bun. First two items are fairly unique, items that draw in the diners from all over Singapore, and the last, simply a really good rendition of an increasingly common dim sum item that almost every Singaporean loves.
The space is humble, the food is simple, but Swee Choon Tim Sum is timeless in its appeal. So the next time you want a taste of authenticity, you know where to go. (Aug 2015)
</p></li><li><h5>THE BUZZ</h5><p>“Don’t be surprised to find a queue well into the early hours for a seat at Swee Choon Tim Sum. The 50-year-old establishment that's a hit with a younger, post-clubbing and night owl set occupies five ground-floor shophouses to keep up with the demand for their signature mee-suah kueh ($1/two), Portuguese egg tarts ($1.50/two) and custard-rich liu sha bao ($3.60/three).” -Time Out Singapore

For a dish that is as delicious as it is Instagram-worthy, try the Sea Urchin Rolled by Wagyu Beef.

Made with thin strips of premium meat cooked at the table, the beef absorbs the flavours of the broth and is so tender, it falls off the fork.

Dig into the Veal Tartare, a rich dish of light beef marrow and meat topped with a generous helping of briny Beluga caviar. The richness of the meat is tempered by the salty taste of the caviar, and makes for a standout combination of flavours. The Ceviche Passionfruit is a sweet and rich dish that combines a staple of Latin cuisine with the vibrant sweetness of passionfruit. The highly-raved Apple lives up to the hype. Made with an isomalt apple shell with a core of apple sorbet and chocolate seeds, this dish is delightfully light and sweet, and makes for a unique dessert. (March 2019)

The basic elements are almost religious in their simplicity: beautifully marbled and fresh meat, a smoky fire, and some subtle dipping sauces to go along. Oh, and bowlfuls of steaming hot rice on which to baste those hot, meaty drippings. 

Here at Tajimaya, the menu is basically page after page of different grades of top-grade meat, though really they are most famous for their offerings of divine Miyazaki Beef offered in a range of cuts from ribeye to chuck short rib. Choose from an à la carte menu or simply get the set, which comes with a generous lineup of sides from crunchy Tempura to a daily selection of Sashimi, as well as a comforting bowl of Garlic Fried Rice. Apart from Miyazaki beef, there is US Wagyu and US Angus, as well as fatty Kurobuta Pork for lovers of that other great barbecue meat. The pork is available in a range of cuts as well, including the unctuous jowl cut, or meltingly tender cheek that will reduce to a fatty sliver of joy in your mouth. 

To undercut all of that meaty goodness, other dishes here include Korean-inspired soups like Kimchi Soup and hot-stone Ishiyaki Dons filled with meat and vegetables crackling from the heat of the bowl. To fill up, slurp up some piping hot Udon. With meat this good, you’ll want very little else but rice, but these other options make this restaurant perfect for hitting every corner of that Japanese craving you’ve been nursing. (Jan 2018)

With quality ingredients that would appeal to Japanese food lovers, expect a menu of classic favourites spread across sushi, sashimi, starters, kushiyaki, agemono, don, steak, and dessert categories. Lunch buddies can enjoy their value sets that come with rice, miso soup, salad, and pickles — with an option to upgrade when you add a chawanmushi, and more. Go for the Beef Yakiniku, Chicken Teriyaki, and Buta Shogayaki options for a hot meal, or choose their premium sets of nigiri and sashimi for a taste trip to Japan, sampling the freshest seafood. Sushi lovers should opt for the Spicy Maguro, with that hint of chilli kickstarting your dining journey. For drinks with colleagues, the best bar snacks take a Japanese turn with Tori Kawa, with crispy chicken skin. Or try the Tako Karaage, with crisp octopus tendrils. Their Kushiyaki Platter of eight skewers has it all: Buta bara, buta enoki, tomato bekon, shiitake, okura and uzura no tamago.

At Tamashii along North Canal Road, that’s precisely what you get. An elegant blend of tradition and panache, food is served on wooden oars in homage to Japanese fishermen who did the same once upon a time.
The freshest ingredients are flown in regularly from Japan, and Chef Patrick Tan continuously goes out of his way to prepare the amazing produce in tantalising, and occasionally fascinating ways! Previous seasonal stunners include grilled squid lips, ivory shell sashmi (called Shiro Baigai in Japanese), and Japanese clams served in a variety of ways.
You can’t go to a Japanese robataya without having some grilled fish though, and the seasonal Barracuda was grilled to perfection. The skin of the fish was crispy, the flesh moist and tender. It tasted of the grill and the sea, and felt like a portal to being seated on the beach, charcoal in the sand, and fish straight from the ocean.
We love the idea of walking into your favourite restaurant and eagerly asking “what’s in season right now?” Whether it’s the fruit of the land or the fruits of the ocean, there’s definitely only the freshest ‘fruit’ on offer at Tamashii, and we’re always eager to be introduced to something new, delicious, and satisfying whenever we visit.

Designed to straddle the line between indoors and outdoors, the beach club takes its cue from the seaside homes of yesteryear, mid-century modernism and nostalgic maritime influences. 

On weekdays, it is a peaceful hideaway from Singapore's concrete jungle, offering a slice of tropical paradise mere minutes away from the heart of the city. 

Over the weekends, the club transforms into a celebration of vibrancy and living a life more carefree. Take your pick from the lively string of parties running all year round, adorn yourselves with specially curated accessories from The Beach Shop and prepare to dance the night away.

Despite what its name suggests, Tekong Seafood Restaurant is rooted firmly on the mainland. Based in Changi Village, this storied culinary establishment that was formerly based on Pulau Tekong has been wowing diners with its consistently fresh seafood and Chinese cuisine for over thirty-five years and counting.
Here, freshness is practically guaranteed as the restaurant tends to use live seafood that has been recently caught by local fishermen off the Singapore coast. And there’s something for everyone. For the health-conscious eaters, the Nyonya Steamed Fish is a great catch – bursting with flavour without the use of any oil. Meanwhile, the Ginger and Spring Onion Lobster is cleverly done, with the bright notes from ginger enhancing the tender lobster flesh. Vegetarians don’t have to despair, as the restaurant has plenty of stellar options to pick from, whether it is the soft Thai Style Tofu, or the crunchy Fried French Beans. And of course, one must not pass on the classic tze char go-to, the fluffy and fragrant Oyster Omelette.
On weekends, you’ll see this eating joint packed to its gills with families large and small. And thanks to its coastal views, dining at Tekong Seafood Restaurant feels like a respite from the usual city life. Now don’t wait, chope a reservation for your next meal there!

Owned by father-and-son duo Paul and Dragg Wong, Tempura Oji is a haven for midnight revellers looking for supper grub. And this is some fine supper nosh indeed. The pair invested in a top-grade flash-frying technology, which means the tempura that comes out from the kitchen here is wonderfully crumbed without being too greasy. 

Try the Supamu Tempura, which sees ‘Made in Japan’ Spam coated in a light batter and deep-fried. Enjoy this with the Pumpkin Tempura and a side of pureed radish and chopped ginger. Fancy a proper tempura meal? The Sea Bass Tempura is tender and sweet, and is a good complement to the Tempura Moriawase, a selection of deep-fried King Tiger Prawns and mixed vegetables such as onion and eggplant.

TEN means “heaven” or “celebration” in Japanese and in the case of TEN Sushi, this can’t be more true: the cosy enclave is little more than a year old but has made its own splash with Sushi Master Marusaya at its helm. So whether you are looking for a mouthwatering array of fresh fish air-flown from Japan, impeccable hand-rolls, or just a comfy bowl of Don, TEN Sushi has got you more than covered. 
The Salmon Tartar provides an enticing sneak peek into the exhilarating epicurean journey ahead. A generous portion of salmon cubes is masterfully drizzled with a tangy spicy sauce that does not mask the salmon’s delightful creaminess, while the runny goodness of a perfectly poached onsen egg elevates the entire appetizer. Jumping right into mains, the sushi steals the show with its sheer freshness. Don’t believe us? Try the delicate 3 Kinds of Blue Fin Tuna Sushi for yourself. The rolls don’t disappoint either - the Fisherman Inside-Out-Roll, for instance, features 10 types of fresh fish, totally changing the game for your usual hand roll. 
Another highlight: the wide selection of sake, whiskey, and beers imported from Japan, so be sure to ask your friendly staff to recommend the perfect accomplice to a great meal!

There is a range of barbecue meats on offer at this restaurant, although the main draw is the wagyu meat. The wagyu here is Kagoshima and Hokkaido wagyu, which is one of the most exquisite cuts of beef available in Japan. The Salmon Belly, Sea Bream, and Tuna are also popular sashimi options.
The crisp Ebi-Fry is a Japanese staple, and perfect for sharing. The Soft-Shell Crab is another popular dish.

At Teochew Restaurant Huat Kee, this informs every dish, from its humblest items, like seasonal vegetables, to its more exquisite ones, like precious ocean bounty.
An award-winning restaurant that has been passed down for three generations of Teochew chefs, Huat Kee is known and loved for its preservation of heritage Teochew flavours, but also its confidence in working with ingredients from far-flung places like Chile and South Africa. Enter the abalone, one of the signature ingredients at this restaurant, and some say done to perfection here. Served braised with sea cucumber, it may not taste like much, but it’s days in the making, and when eaten, is pillowy, soft, and bursting with briny goodness. There’s also Teochew-style duck, braised and served sliced on a platter with stewed pork belly, marinated eggs, tofu, and a lashing of sweet, herbal gravy. Steamed Pomfret, a Teochew hallmark, and one of the restaurant’s signatures, arrives shiny and pearlescent on the table, strewn with fine aromatic garnishes, and a light poaching liquor. The meat gives way in firm but perfectly tender chunks. For truly festive occasions, a whole, glistening, crisp-skinned suckling pig is available, too, and the meal is best rounded off with some signature Yam Paste, cooked with lard to perfection and topped with stewed pumpkin and gingko nuts.
 A mix of humble fare prepared to perfection, and premium ingredients prepared with masterful simplicity: Teochew Restaurant Huat Kee is a heritage restaurant, of the best in Asia, and available at your doorstep.

Established in a refurbished shophouse and seating less than 50, this intimate eatery serves up fresh sukiyaki, sashimi, and sushi made with fresh ingredients sourced directly from Japan.

However, the true highlight of this spot is that it is the perfect place to indulge in some Omakase dishes that can be tailor-made according to your preferences. Diners can give celebrated Japanese chef Kenji Okumura guidance on their desired ingredients and flavours, and in a “reversed” Omakase experience, the chef will do his best to incorporate them in a bespoke menu. With ingredients sourced directly from Japan, and with all new ingredients chosen specifically by Chef Okumura, diners can rest assured that they will be in good hands at this restaurant. 

The Omakase menu makes use of ingredients from various regions of Japan, such as Iseshima oysters, Ise Ebi and Akamoku seaweed from the Mie Prefecture, Unagi from Shimanto and other fresh produce imported directly. Having satisfied personalities such as Gorbachev, Wen Jiabao, and the Japanese Emperor himself with his Omakase creations, diners are sure to enjoy the creations of Chef Okumura.

The Japanese city is well-known for its popular okonomiyaki dishes, and you’ll find this a mainstay on the menu at Teppan Works. Try the Signature Cheese Okonomiyaki, made from your choice of sharp gorgonzola, a light buffalo mozzarella, creamy camembert, or a rich raclette. The cheese is then cooked into the Japanese savoury pancake, with a crack of black pepper and a dash of fiery chilli oil. For something a little meatier, the Special Okonomiyaki is a must-try. The pancake here is stuffed with juicy slices of pork belly and beef tendon, mixed with potato and a fried egg for an indulgent treat.

Otherwise, order a slab of the Wagyu Ribeye for sharing — the beef is cooked simply over the grill, then served with a dash of salt and pepper to bring out the rich, buttery flavours of the cut. For dessert, save space for the restaurant’s signature Warabi Mochi. Made with fine kinako (roasted soy bean) powder and black sugar syrup, these fluffy little pillows are the perfect sweet treat to end a delicious meal. (Apr 2019)

And with drinks from an award-winning mixologist, matched with trendy fare from a culinary heavy-hitter, it's easy to obsess over Tess.
Like any it-girl, or it-restaurant for that matter, Tess has a distinctive style, swagger and can back it all up with bona fide coolness. That confidence comes from tatted-up head chef Martin Wong, with L'Atelier de Joël Robuchon kitchen cred and whose expertise in fine dining and playful personality comes through in a variety of small, medium and large plates, which vary in fanciness, but all aim to satisfy.
Behind the bar, you can find the shaken-up creations of Steve Leong, the well-known finalist of Diageo Reserve World Class' Singapore 2013. That means that the cocktails are as fine as the dining at Tess, whether you go with old world classics or newfangled tipples. He's not alone in dreaming up drinks, however, as Tess plays host to the city's up and comers in the bar scene, in what turns out to be an open mic night of sorts, that the regular patrons, and there are a lot of them, love.
Settle into the hip, glowy space that's configured for optimal hanging out. From the menu, the Duet Scallop & Aburi Tartare shows off Tess' fancier side, with scorched meaty scallops played against a refreshing chopped tartare. Also from the small plates, the Crispy Pork Belly is simplistic in its flavour, served with a fusion dip, forming a savoury, finger-licking good dish. From the Medium Plates, the Tess Wagyu Cubes & Bone Marrow is a surefire winner, with pan seared cuts of beef glazed with veal jus and marrow, just in case you needed more of a meat hit.
It's not all about the carnivores, though, as a selection of cheeses and even Vegan mains (a rare sight at Singapore fine dining restaurants, let alone a bar) can satisfy meatless diners. From that section, the Bohemian Vegetables Love is a colourful tangle of grilled zucchini, capsicum, aubergine and a piquant red pepper coulis. Finally, from the limited selection of dessert, the Chocolate Fondant with Blueberry Compote shows that the kitchen keeps careful measure of foodie trends, with savoury elements of spicy apple crumble accenting the luscious classic cake.
In the end, it's not just the good looks and impressive resume at Tess that will have you coming back for more, but the rotating food and drinks menu of creative selections. In fact, you are sure to learn what other fans already know: when it comes to Tess, just say yes.

""Well for starters you may find it hard to find a seat, which is already the case at Tess Bar & Kitchen where Chef Martin Wong whips up gourmet bar bites and delectable dishes like the Tess Wagyu Cubes & Bone Marrow, and Steve Leong of Bitters & Love fame makes custom cocktails using premium spirits, juices, fruits and herbs."" -Urban Journey

Thanying Singapore's chic interior carries a modern and refreshing design theme with brighter lighting, chrome-plated and matt black metallic fixtures juxtaposing against leather, velvet-clad chairs and wooden bone-herring flooring. Ceiling to floor glass windows cast sunlight onto a long gallery of photographs capturing the landscape, culture, arts and lifestyle of Thailand. Two cosy private rooms sitting 8 each are perfect for private dining.

Start your culinary adventure with the Yam Som Oh, a salad made with sweet pomelo, a generous serving of chicken and prawn, chilli, and topped with tangy lemon juice for an extra edge. This refreshing salad will awaken your taste-buds and prep your tongue for the onslaught of flavours to come. While classics like Tom Yam Goong, Gaeng Keow, and Gaeng Ped are available, the main that truly stands out is Prow Pla Nam Daeng, a hearty soup made with generous chunks of fish maw. 

Looking for something a little moreish? Look no further than the Khao Ohb Sapparod - pineapple fried rice served with juicy chicken pieces and topped with sweet and salty pork floss. The tangy taste of the pineapple gives this dish a fresh tropical twist, while the flavoured pieces of chicken and vegetables add texture and complex flavours to what would otherwise be a regular plate of fried rice.

Located in the swish Duo Galleria, this spot has made a name for itself as one of the few places in the city that offer a modern drinking experience with a nod to our roots. With an exposed brick interior, sleek lighting, and a posh feel, this spot wouldn’t look out of place on the streets of Melbourne.

The seafood and poultry dishes are popular choices, and for good reason! Both dishes offer a hefty portion of meat without an exorbitant price tag. There are even gluten-free and plant-based options for diners who have dietary restrictions. The Mushroom Pizza is great for sharing. The crust is made in-house, and makes for a light base that doesn’t overpower the earthy mushroom toppings.

Come here for a tipple or two, or dance the night away to some downtempo funk. Whether you’re in the mood for wine or whisky, a Singapore Sling or a Mojito, the staff will be happy to make recommendations. </p></li><li><h5>DISHES WE LOVE</h5><p>Mushroom Pizza, Singapore Sling, Mojito, Salt and Pepper Squid</p></li><li><h5>PROMOTION</h5><p>Weekday Set Lunch

Tuck into their decadent creations at their 80-seater standalone burger bar located in Quayside.
Helmed by executive chef Adam Penney, the burgers here are made from scratch using only premium European cheeses and two cuts of grass-fed Australian beef for the patties. The sauces are also made in-house, so you can expect to find quirky combinations on the menu here! Sink your teeth into exclusive creations like the Bun DMC, with a unique homemade watermelon rind relish stacked on barang goweng (fried shallots) on well-toasted buns with melted cheese. Or, go all out with the Red Man Burger, a nod to Singapore’s iconic dish beef rendang. Here, the beef cheeks are sous vide for 24 hours until meltingly tender, slathered with a sweet and spicy blend of gula melaka and over 10 spices that has been lovingly stewed for two hours. Housemade virgin coconut mayo is added to this concoction,sandwiched between two coconut buns.
There’s no denying the burgers at Three Buns Quayside are decadent — come hungry and relish every moment!

On offer is a menu that sprawls across Western, Korean, and Thai cuisines, the strong aromas of each intermingling in the air.
You get to choose your meat of choice, and have it dressed with a sauce of your choice, from buttery French sauces to punchy Korean glazes. But before that, warm up the stomach with some appetizers, like fragrant Tom Yum Soup, crunchy Potato Skins, or flaky Kimchi Pancakes. Then choose a plate of carbohydrates to support the oncoming barbecue onslaught. There’s Korean and Thai stir-fried noodles and fried rice, ranging from oil-slicked Glass Noodles to aromatic Pineapple Rice, as well as simple pastas like Pesto and Mac & Cheese. Then it’s time for the main event. There’s a premium grilled seafood menu that features Boston Lobster, Squid, Grilled Oyster, and Tiger Prawns, with sauce options like Lemon Garlic Butter, Creamy Salted Egg, Tom Yum, and Korean Garlic sauce. There’s also grilled meats, like tender Ribeye Steak, unctuous Beef Cheek, perfect done the French way with a vigorous searing and a lick of jus. Then there’s marinated Korean-style beef and pork for that hit of Korean barbecue, a mix of spicy and caramelized flavours, and the occasional hit of black pepper.
Options abound at this gorgeous barbecue restaurant, a true step up from low-fi East Coast Park barbecues. The premium meats and elegant sauces will give you a fantastic gourmet experience, while you enjoy the chill and laid-back open-air environment that’s the best way to enjoy Singapore’s weather.

Thus Coffee is one of them, a specialty coffee joint in a charming residential area along Jalan Kuras, just a couple of minutes away from the Lower Peirce Reservoir Park. The space isn’t massive, but it’s very chic, done up with handsome wooden touches and a brushed concrete floor that announces its serious-coffee intentions. They’ve got an in-house roast and blend that they use for their coffees which promises a robust pick-me-up, but beyond a cuppa the food here is also to die for. Think subtle variations on the all-day breakfast menu, including treats like their in-house breakfast plate that features sous vide eggs on a fluffy muffin, paired with apple cider sausage, back bacon, mushrooms, and baked beans. Or the Salmon & Kale Toast, a fluffy brioche toastie topped with smoked salmon and avocado, creamy eggs, and a spinach and feta salad.

Lunch plates here take a heartier turn, with numbers like the Korean-inspired Chicken Cutlet Jyolmeon, chewy Gochujang-drenched noodles topped with a crispy chicken cutlet and sunny side up egg. The pasta here isn’t your garden variety stuff either, with punchy plates like the Linguine Puttanesca, bursting with ripe olives, piquant capers, chunky tomatoes, and briny anchovies. No self-respecting millennial outfit is complete with a grain bowl, and here the Wagyu Beef Grain Bowl takes pride of place, featuring tender beef atop a mélange of pearl barley and quinoa for some good artery-clearing health benefits and lots of toothsome flavour. Come for the mid-day coffee but stay for the mid-day snack and maybe dinner at this charming, Instagram-worthy haunt in one of Singapore’s most idyllic little neighbourhoods. (Feb 2018)

From the beautiful art on the walls to the homely dishes on the menu, everything about this spot is comforting, making it the perfect place to unwind after a long day. 

The menu items here are healthy dishes meant to feed the stomach and soul. The Asian Prawn & Quinoa Salad is a light dish of spiced shrimp tossed with avocado, greens, tomatoes, and cucumbers, and sprinkled with quinoa pearls. The tender shrimp and crisp greens make for a great texture combination, and the cucumber and tomatoes give the dish a fresh flavour that is hard to pass up. Diners after something more than a salad will enjoy the Salmon & Kale Stir Fry. Made with a generous serving of salmon tossed in kale with chilli and garlic, this dish is simple, spicy, and delicious.

For something a little heartier, opt for the Chorizo & Kale Broth. A rich stew of spiced Italian sausage, sprigs of kale, and juicy tomatoes, this is the perfect pick-me-up on a cold day, and is best enjoyed warm. The ever-popular burger is a crowd favourite, and for good reason. Made with a juicy meat patty and thick cut fries, this dish will satisfy all your cravings.

Not only do these plates of wonder attract epicureans from across the country, but local celebrities have been seen tucking into the nosh here, as evidenced by photographs of famous faces posing for photographs with Tonny plastered across the walls. 

When dining at Tonny Restaurant, one mustn’t skip out on the epic Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. Made from juicy scallops, egg whites, and tasty fish roe, this dish promises to be a knockout for the senses. Then there’s the Steamed Pantin Fish which showcases Tonny’s roots in Hong Kong and Singapore. Here, this butterflied fish is topped with copious amounts of ginger paste and chilli paste on either side, and enhanced with light touches of oil and soy sauce.  

If you want to round off a satisfying meal on a sweet note, we suggest going for options such as the Deep Fried Banana Yam Roll or healthful Double Boiled Bird’s Nest with Brown Sugar. Craving authentic Cantonese fare? Hit up Tonny Restaurant for the real deal. (Sep 2017)

However, there are rarely restaurants that succeed at marrying several aspects of the spectrum together, and TORIO is one of them. Their menu combines premium ingredients to dish out delicious recipes at affordable prices. Named after the Japanese word for trio, this restaurant is dedicated to showcasing the camaraderie, contribution, and commitment of its founding partners through their dishes. 

The Special Sashimi is a must-try. The plate features premium ingredients like Tuna, Salmon, and Sea Urchin, as well as two kinds of white fish -- well worth the price paid, being generous on portions and taste. The meat is plump and fresh, and the slices are paper-thin, which easily absorb the flavours of the condiments they are dipped into. Prefer a hearty grab-and-go lunch? Try the Unagi Don, a rich bowl of fluffy steamed rice served with a sizeable portion of grilled Japanese eel. The fish is spongy and the sweet and salty flavour of the meat gives flavour to the fragrant, pearly rice. (Mar 2019)

The restaurant’s aim is to serve the best authentic Peranakan cuisine to Singapore and the world.  It was set up jointly with Baba Benjamin’s mother Bibik Daisy Seah, a well respected Peranakan chef.

True Blue Cuisine is the place for a good Peranakan feat - drawing locals and food lovers from all over the world.  Legendary dishes are their Ngoh Hiang (Minced Chicken and Prawn meat rolls wrapped in Beancurd skin), Jantong Pisang salad (Banana Blossoms with Cucumber), Ayam Buah Keluak (Chicken stewed with Indonesian black nuts), Beef Rendang (Beef simmered in a coconut sauce/dry curry) and Kari Kepala Ikan (Whole fish head curry).
True Blue Cuisine is situated beside the Peranakan museum at 49 Armenian Street, and it compliments the museum and brings to life an all-round experience of the rich Peranakan culture.

Regardless of which outlet you visit in Singapore, you can be assured that each exquisite morsel on your plate has been carefully planned by a team of chefs who really understand the nuances of Chinese cooking and are willing to take risks as they push the boundaries for a better dining experience. Indeed, Tunglok has a way of taking the most basic of Chinese dishes and ramping up its flavour and style quotient. 

Take the Tung Lok Flaming Fortune Chicken for instance. The wedding banquet staple, roast chicken, has been updated in spectacular style. It arrives at your table wreathed in flame, and if that's not enough spectacle, its taste doesn’t disappoint with its plump and juicy flesh. Another poultry dish, the Roast Irish Duck, is made using only the best Irish Duck from Silver Hill Farm. If you ever thought the Irish were only known for four-leaf clovers and leprechauns, you might want to add duck to your list. The flesh of the bird is so juicy and flavourful that you wonder what magic happens in the farm and in the Tunglok Signatures kitchen. (Aug 2016)

With its first along Orchard so successful, this Taiwanese concept is now making waves at the Kallang Wave Mall. Bringing Taiwanese favourites and the comforting taste of home-cooked meals, Typhoon Cafe is ready to catch the hearts of the easties of Singapore. Boasting an extensive menu, you will be spoilt for choice with every category. For starters, go for their signature savoury Typhoon Momofuku Buns with melt-in-your-mouth tender pork belly, or try out their crispy Oyster Omelette with generous helpings of fresh oysters. Warm yourselves up on cold days with a comforting bowl of Crab Meat Broth with Glass Noodles, or replenish your inner ‘qi’ with a nourishing bowl of Herbal Chicken Soup. A must-try at Typhoon is their Signature Tawainese Oyster Mee Sua with Braised Pork Intestine. Noodles, a rich broth, chewy pork intestines, and ocean-fresh oysters - all combined into a perfect steaming bowl of perfection. For heartier dishes, we would recommend their Steamed Barramundi with Shimeji Mushrooms in Hong Kong Sauce and Claypot Sauteed String Beans with Pork Intestines. The shimeji mushrooms bring a lovely crunch to firm and juicy Barramundi meat whilst the pork intestines add a delicious texture to the crunchy string beans.

Founded by four friends with varying expertise, this restaurant specialises in authentic Thai cuisine and is modelled after the communal dining restaurants of Thailand. The first overseas outpost of this popular Thai restaurant specialises in Thai classics, and also brings us a variety of new dishes that are equally as tempting.

The Issan Spicy Grilled Pork Neck Fried Rice is one of the popular menu items, and features buttery rice stir-fried in a mix of spices and topped with tender pork neck meat. The richness of the pork meat combined with the fragrant rice makes for a filling meal. Another unique menu item is  the Minced Pork Dip In Preserved Soy Bean And Coconut Milk Served With Rice Crackers. The tender pork and coconut together is a deliciously sweet combination, and is tempered by the briny flavour of preserved soybean. 

For something a little lighter, opt for the Steamed Whole Sea Bass In Spicy Lime Sauce. The tangy and spicy sauce combined with the tenderness of the steamed fish is irresistable. Enjoy this dish with a bowl of steamed rice, or dig into it on its own.

With 20 outlets in Japan, this is the first overseas outpost of the beloved unagi franchise. Famed for their expert grilling techniques and secret in-house sauces, this unagi restaurant is a must-visit for diners who love fine Japanese dining.

The Unagi here is served in three different styles, namely: Hitsumabushi - where the eel is placed over a bed of rice and served with three condiments, Seiro Mushi, which is served with Hokkaido rice, egg, and a sweet sauce, and Mamushi Donburi, which is served with Japanese yam, mentaiko, kinshi eggs and onsen egg. The latter two dishes are unique to the Singaporean incarnation of the restaurant, while the former is a signature dish available at all outlets. The unagi for all three dishes is marinated in a spice mixture made with ingredients directly imported from Tokyo before being steamed, then subsequently grilled - just as they do at all outlets across Japan.

Whether you’re an unagi connoisseur or just a fan of seafood, the wallet-friendly prices, intimate dining environment, and exquisite dishes here will surely entice you to visit more than once!

With a pleasant waterfront view and accommodating dining room, Uncle Leong's is aimed at making diners feel at home. After all, a hearty meal of Chinese seafood delicacies is a family tradition for most of us, and the next best thing to home cooked, is the variety of delectable treats at Uncle Leong's. Here, shellfish are sourced as fresh as possible, and a variety of sizes are available for diners to choose from. 
Along with the traditional Chilli Crab and Bee Hoon that's long been a signature of this seafood institution, Uncle Leong's features several other delightful concoctions that are worth a try. The Shimmering Sand Crab Delight offers a particularly savoury sauce and pleasing crunchy texture that's often missing in crab dishes. Speaking of crunch, the Gold Coast Prawn amps up the cereal recipe, with deliciously plump crustaceans in a spiced mix of golden, crispy topping. For the carnivores, the Guinness Pork Ribs is a favourite, with thick, mahogany sauce gaining tons of caramelised flavour from the distinctive beer, a perfect match for the meaty pork ribs. Made for sharing and family style enjoyment, Uncle Leong Seafood should be on every seafood fan's must-try list!

Exposed brick walls, sakura woods, and simple fabric chairs give the space a warm vibe but doesn’t overwhelm – an excellent way to let the wagyu-centric dishes shine.Ushidoki’s kaiseki dinners are prepared by Chef Hirohashi Nobuaki, and you can choose different types of omakase sets. You’ll probably skip the 12-course menu if you’re not famished, but a wagyu beef lover would well be tempted to give it a shot. There’s wagyu salad, a luxuriously prepared wagyu sukiyaki, and 3-kind wagyu sashimi moriawase where chef picks include wagyu wrapped around uni (sea urchin) and oyster topped with wagyu. The meat is Ozaki wagyu beef – a big deal since there’s only one farm in Japan that sells wagyu under this name – and finding a restaurant serving the same Ozaki beef is incredibly rare.If you’re looking for quality dishes that revolve around premium beef and done in Japanese style, book early for Ushidoki – especially since they claim to serve the whole cow in one course.

The eels are carefully selected and this commitment to quality and freshness shows from the crispy, fluffy, and creamy unagi. In fact, the tare, or sauce, is made using Uya’s highly treasured secret recipe that has been passed down through the generations. The eel is delivered live from Japan and stored behind the kitchen before they are prepared and grilled daily. 

The main star here’s definitely the Hitsumabushi served with condiments, broth, soup, and pickles. The best way to savour the different flavours is simply to divide the unagi rice into four portions and enjoy it with some condiments, with the dashi broth and condiments provided, on its own, or any way you like! Different flavours come through with every quarter, making for a delightful culinary experience that’s truly exciting. No part of the eel goes to waste, so don’t forget to try the Kimoyaki (grilled liver) and the Hone Senbei (Bone Crackers) - they taste as delicious as they sound intimidating. Don’t pass up on this gem even if you don’t enjoy unagi. Dishes such as the Rare Wagyu Rice Bowl, the Sashimi Moriawase, and Oyster Tempura will also give you plenty reason to return!

With all three owners having roots in either California or Texas, and growing up on true-blue Mexican eats, it’s safe to say they know a thing or two about the flavour explosion the cuisine brings with it.

A quick glance at Vatos’ “Seoul-Mex” menu and you’ll know exactly what we mean. They dish out masterful fusion creations like the hefty Kimchi Galbi Grilled Cheese. Pieces of marinated Galbi short rib - bearing a moreish taste that comes from properly grilled meat - are sandwiched between slices of sourdough bread. Sounds simple? It's anything but. Each bite is a veritable bomb of umami, with Mexican cheese and savoury fried kimchi lending their own punchy kick.

The sandwich itself is pretty filling so if you prefer a slower pace, we recommend going for a range of their popular tacos. From Baja Fish to Chimichurri Chicken, these are the perfect portable snacks. Finally, no visit is complete without Kimchi Carnitas Fries plus a basket of Honey Tequila Chicken Wings to go with one of Vatos' signature margaritas, so be sure to order one (or two) of each before you head out!

It’s savoury, delicious and full of peppery goodness. For something meat-free, go for their Meatless Burger that’s served with cheese and guacamole on fluffy buns. For a boozy experience, go for a cool pint of Singapore Lager to pair. Looking for a taste of the ocean? Go for their Laksa Salmon - seared salmon with laksa gravy served with a side of mashed potatoes and greens. At Vibe Bistro, you can choose from a wide selection of alcohol to match your dish, and the Assam Delight is the perfect cocktail to pair with the Laksa Salmon with its citrussy flavours.

Be swept away the minute you step through the eatery’s doors, with its overhung foliage, beautifully aged-wood tables, and minimalist decor that will make you feel like being in the provincial countryside.
Sporting a winsome French-Italian menu, this dining destination prides itself on its farm-to-table concept, scouting for produce and ingredients such as quail, frog legs, and fish right from our very own doorstep. For instance, one showstopper is its Whole Fried Local Quail that comes accompanied with a rich plum and berries compote and a side of crispy kale. The Walnut Crusted Bull Frog is another stellar option, highlighting frog legs from a Jurong farm paired perfectly with a teriyaki-sesame dressing. Then end the meal on a tangy citrusy note  guaranteed to perk up the taste buds. For that, we love the Lemon Lava cake that goes down smooth with fresh vanilla chantilly cream.
Romantic and dreamy, the Vineyard at HortPark has all the makings of a garden wonderland, complete with beautifully crafted plates that highlight the fresh produce our little red dot has to offer.

For a restaurant of such pedigree, it exudes a tremendous amount of contemporary elegance while keeping the food fastidiously traditional. As you might expect of a Cantonese restaurant, seafood reigns high on their list of priorities, but that doesn’t mean they neglect the rest. Famous for being packed during Sunday ‘yum cha’ hours, you can also prepare your appetite for exquisite lunchtime dim sum as well as aromatic Cantonese grilled meats.
The Dim Sum menu boasts all the favourites, executed with a perfectionist’s hand. Stack your table with flaky Baked Barbecued Pork Buns, delicate Steamed Glutinous Rice Dumplings, tender-centred Baked Egg Tarts, and pillowy Steamed Carrot Cake. Wah Lok does equally well in its banquet-style fare, turning out incomparable seafood with inimitable Cantonese flair. Whether it’s premium Australian King Crab, Live Abalone, Coral Trout, or Hokkaido Scallops, expect simple but effective culinary magic that will transform your chosen seafood into delicate mouthfuls of rich, oceany flavour. And if you’re looking to impress a boss or potential in-law, bring out the big guns: Chilled Foie Gras & Whole Abalone is one of the kitchen’s signatures, sure to seal any deal. Wah Lok’s reputation precedes it, and the restaurant more than lives up to its name. (Mar 2018)

Developed in Tokyo by ANZCO Foods, a New Zealand-based meat company specializing in premium-quality New Zealand beef and lamb in Tokyo, WAKANUI takes its name from the location of ANZCO’s Five Star Beef Feedlot on the coast of Wakanui, South Canterbury. The ‘stars’ of WAKANUI and the essence of the restaurant are New Zealand Ocean Beef and WAKANUI Spring Lamb, which are grilled over Japan-sourced Binchotan charcoal in the centrally-placed, open kitchen. The beef displays the perfect balance of marbling and leanness, while retaining natural juiciness and an intense beef flavour. The lamb possesses peak flavour and texture. These optimal levels of quality are achieved by the precise and careful control that ANZCO Foods exercises over every step of the production process, from start to finish. The restaurant also showcases the best of New Zealand produce, including seasonal seafood and hand-picked wines. (Jul 2019)

Catching a lobster during one of his typical leisurely diving trips off an isolated island, the lack of other ingredients forced Chef Lau Siaw Dee to throw together a quick meal using only rice, seawater, and the aforementioned crustacean. Surprise, surprise! The salty combination worked so well, it became an instant hit once Chef Lau brought it back home – after much refinement of course.
Today's iteration is a Teochew-style porridge, whose loose grains float in a yellow broth that's been richly flavoured with lobster roe, accompanied by a bevy of fresh lobsters sitting under a blanket of fresh spring onions. It's both comforting and decadent without being too much on the palate. There's also plenty more on the menu that can round out your meal, from poultry dishes like Seven Spice Pork Choplets to local staples like Braised Yee Fu Noodles and Sambal Fried Rice.
For mouth-watering Chinese food that's packed with plenty of local flavour and an exceptional bowl of lobster porridge, only one place comes to mind, and this is it.

From the kitchen comes Asian-style bites that are familiar yet innovative at the same time. Start dinner with the Pork and Seafood Roll Bite, a modern spin on Hei Zou. The deep-fried Pork and Seafood Roll here is rich with bounty from the sea and land, prepared with minced pork belly and diced sea prawns, mixed with crunchy turnips and cuttlefish paste. Eat this together with the refreshing homemade achar that is served on the side. Another dish to try is the Foie Gras Lotus Leaf Rice, a decadent dish of seared goose liver mixed with rice perfumed with garlic, sesame oil, and porcini mushrooms, wrapped in a fragrant lotus leaf. Pair these delectable bites with fruit-forward wines bursting with notes of ripe cherries, raspberries, and toasted oak.At TWGF, wines are imported directly from wineries around the world. With the economy of scale, elimination of multiple tiers of middlemen, and good relationships with wineries, they are able to continuously provide affordable, high-quality wines to all guests.

Set up by Swiss vintner, Dominique Giroud, and Swiss owner, Claude Dizerens, the space is a restaurant, bar, and wine cellar rolled into one. The inside is furnished in a modern style with plenty of dark accents and simple lines – perhaps all the better to highlight the food and drink. However, if you’re in the mood for ambiance that’s a little more laidback, the sidewalk al fresco area might be more to your liking.

It’s not often that Switzerland comes to mind when you’re in the mood for wine but that’s exactly what Wine Universe hopes to change. Besides the usual suspects from France and Italy, their incredibly extensive wine selection – easily over 50 types of wine – also introduces several Swiss options that often go overlooked. Worried about getting a little tipsy with only drinks and no nosh? Try some of the contemporary dishes on offer. Taking inspiration from the Swiss culinary culture, the menu comprises of items like Wiener Schnitzel, Escalope Viennoise, Raclette, Matterhorn  Rösti, and more.

Not only does the lack of excessive crowds mean that the restaurant is a great venue to hang out at, the food and, most importantly, wine are also fantastic representations of the Swiss gastronomic landscape.

over Europe. The name is derived from two elements: the expansive and carefully curated selection of quality wines, as well as, the signature hearty dishes served on stone boards. With a
concept revolving around the keywords: simple, attractive, authentic and affordable, one can expect quality wines starting at just $8 a glass and $38 a bottle, including take-home options that
can be bought directly from the retail store at the corner of the restaurant.
While you are there, be sure to dig into signatures like the Mixed Platter that serves some of the finest cold cuts, cheese, olives and bread at just $32. Other signatures includes the decadent
Rigatoni Prawn, which promises to leave the delightful tangy flavours of a rich sauce accompanied by al dente pasta and crunch fresh prawns. A vegetarian alternative of this dish is also
available upon request. The Pan-Seared Cod Fish is another new favourite, presenting a golden-brown gleaming cod surrounded by a bed of sautéed spinach soaked in a light fish velouté with
fresh clam juice and finished with a generous squeeze of lemon, erupting the senses with a myriad of flavours.
Opens daily, except Mondays, from 12pm until 3pm and 5pm until 10pm.

One of Singapore’s most popular dishes, Chilli Crab, is a star item on the menu.

The menu consists of cafe fare jazzed up with upscale ingredients. Expect foie gras, aioli, and Iberico ham.

Boasting an Egg Confit to Dashi Risotto, diners can savour an array of exciting fusion dishes that will win them over to Wonderland. 

The Egg Confit is a great way to whet your appetite before your mains arrive. Made with eggs, crispy potato, truffle jus, and potato mousseline. The mixture of textures in this dish give it a unique mouthfeel that you’ll want to savour. The light eggs and hearty potatoes make for an unlikely but delicious combination. Continuing with the unique dish trend, try the Dashi Risotto. Made with Miso Chicken Dashi, seaweed furikake, arborio rice, and mushroom, the recipe here puts a Japanese spin on an Italian staple. Meat lovers can indulge in the Iberico Pork. Served with earthy garlic chips and creamy aioli, the buttery taste of the pork will leave you craving for more long after the last bite. (April 2019)

Instead, Wooloomooloo is among the best classic refineries of steakdom in this hemisphere, with a name from Down Under, and years of experience from the namesake Hong Kong restaurant group. Including everything that has made steakhouses its own genre - premium cuts, elegant décor and classic trimmings - Wooloomooloo is set to ""steak"" its claim as one of the premier houses in Singapore.
From the 3rd floor of the Raffles City Shopping Center, Wooloomooloo boasts a picturesque view of Stamford Road, St. Andrew's Cathedral, and for Formula One enthusiasts, Turn 9 of the only night race in the world. There is much to be proud of, with an expansive lounge and dining area flanked by handsome leather seating and stacked wood touches that have become iconic. Aboriginal dot paintings pay homage to the Aussie title while an impressive meat case and open kitchen pay homage to the other source of the restaurant's greatness, its remarkable steaks.
With more offerings than it has O's, the range is well-varied and precisely prepared - think jumbo prawn cocktails, a mammoth Australian Black Angus Tomahawk, a highly sought after USDA prime rib eye, and a gorgeous bread and butter pudding if there ever was one. Take our word for it, when it comes to steak, go classic. Go Wooloomooloo. (Jun 2016)</p></li><li><h5>THE BUZZ</h5><p>""Starters are outstanding: deliciously creamy yellow fin tuna and spanner crab tartare ($29) and jumbo prawn cocktail ($29), seriously large and meaty and served with a horseradishy tomato dip. But we're mainly here for the beef: an Australian Black Angus ribeye steak ($62) and a USDA 150-day wet-aged ribeye ($74)."" -Expat Living
""The formula is solid and simple: dark leather furnishings with a fresh wood motif, soft lighting to emphasise the view, plus, of course, top-quality Aussie beef. Let the meat sweats begin."" -Time Out Singapore
""The steaks of course, are the stars of Wooloomooloo, seasoned with sea salt, broiled and then served with four choices of homemade sauces (Red Wine Madeira, Au Jus, Peppercorn and Mushroom) or gourmet mustards (Dijon, English, Granary and Green Peppercorn). Cut variety is plentiful, catering to even the most ravenous of meat-eaters (including a 20-ounce porterhouse and tomahawk for two)."" -Lifestyle Asia
""Some days you just need some good steak. This established grill (originally from Hong Kong) serves premium Aussie and USDA steaks and grill faves, hitting all the right spots!"" -The Honeycombers</p></li><li><h5>DISHES WE LOVE</h5><p>Tuna & Spanner Crab, Jumbo Prawn Cocktail, Australian Black Angus Tomahawk, Bread & Butter Pudding</p></li><li><h5>PROMOTIONS</h5><p>Happy Hour

Small and cosy, this place is ideal for evening waffle dates, or for just sitting with a cold drink in one hand, watching one of the oldest neighborhoods in Singapore go by.
The hipster cafe trend has resulted in several must-have items on every self-respecting local cafe menu. A salted egg dish or two, a crab dish of some kind, truffle fries, craft beer. In this aspect, Workbench Bistro does not disappoint. It has not two, but four salted egg dishes on offer -- Salted Egg Chicken Pasta, Salted Egg Chicken Burger, Salted Egg Wings, and Salted Egg Wedges. The salted egg sauce is delightfully savory, and pairs well with the meats it comes with. There are two crab dishes, Crab Meat Linguine and Crab Cake Burger, that come chock full of fresh crab meat. If you come in a group, a must-order for sharing is the Signature Truffle Fries, which has that unmistakable aroma of truffle that is both appetizing and addictive. With the variety of craft beers available, and fluffy waffles for dessert, Workbench Bistro will undoubtedly make any cafe hopper very satisfied. (Sep 2016)

Its distinctive red lanterns, plastic chairs, and loud decor just call out to you as you walk past, not unlike the pervy men in the past who used to line this very street leering at the ladies of the night who used to operate around the area.
XYT’s food, too, is loud, bold and in-your-face. Start your meal with the all-time classic, Braised Duck. At XYT, the meat of the duck is tender, yet provides enough of a bite to allow you to savour the juice of the sinews. To share, you will not regret ordering a Lu Rou Fan (braised meat on rice), which, at XYT, uses minced wagyu instead of the normal pork. The ubiquitous street food is thus upgraded to an almost unrecognisable form, but it is an evolution that we daresay is worth the calories. As the sun sets on Duxton Hill and lights from other eating establishments flicker on around you, sit back and reminisce about the days of old Duxton as you enjoy the retro charm with a cocktail or two from the XYT bar.

Serving a wide dimsum menu, Xing Hua is great for tea time getaways with their Xiao Long Bao (or Fish Caviar Xiao Long Bao if you’re fancy) and crispy Golden Seafood Rolls. But don’t let their Dim Sum menu get all the attention. Xing Hua serves a whole host of mains that you can feast on to your heart’s delight. For starters, try their Chilled Drunken Chicken with Chinese Wine, a delightfully tender and juicy all-time favourite. Xing Hua’s delicately soft Pickled Pepper Chicken Feet is another must-try option as well. Their signature dishes include their hearty and savoury Heng Hwa Lor Mee, a braised noodle dish that is warm and comforting. If noodles are not your thing, their Putian Signature Seafood Fried Rice is a great main for sharing. With fresh seafood mixed with fragrant aromatics and stir-fried till brown, this delicious dish can be eaten alone or with sides. Xing Hua also serves a spread of ala carte dishes that you can feast on. Try their Deep Fried Duck with Yam, a savoury-sweet dish that’s crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. For a more unorthodox dish, we recommend their Seaweed Oyster, delicately deep-fried so that the oysters on the inside stay plump and juicy. After a sumptuous meal, their Roselle Jelly is just the thing to help ease all their delicious and hearty dishes down to finish off on a sweet note.

It’s pretty much a given that red meat-lovers will have the time of their lives at Yakiniku Ohji, which offers a luscious spread of Wagyu beef cuts that can be grilled to tender perfection over charcoal fires.

Admire the exquisite marbling that comes with beef of superb quality, and watch as it slowly cooks over your gridiron; the fact that the restaurant uses charcoal fires gives an exquisite charred facet to the taste of the meat. What truly sets Yakiniku Ohji apart from other similar restaurants, however, is the fact that it imports the entire cattle – this allows the restaurant to offer up a selection of rare cuts, each more flavoursome and succulent than the last.

It’s a favourite amongst discerning diners looking for a quiet and discreet location for a luxurious and refined dimsum brunch, or more elaborate Cantonese feasts for special occasions. Expect the height of fine Chinese cuisine, shot through with the balance and richness of pure Cantonese cuisine. Nothing says special occasion quite like a Braised Whole Abalone in Superior Oyster Sauce, an entire lobe of the meaty treasure in an umami broth, paired with crunchy seasonal greens. A similar, less wallet-busting dish is the Braised Sea Supreme Cucumber with Corn Broth, a lovely blend of savoury and sweet flavours with the incomparable texture of high quality sea cucumber. 

Cantonese cuisine is nothing without a soup centrepiece, and here there’s a stunning Double-boiled Sea Whelk Consommé with Garlic, served in a teapot for some extra theatre with the deep oceaney flavours. Meat dishes here come with a similarly high-end flourish. Think Pan-Fried Chicken with Morel in Superior Soy Sauce, a humble poultry dish given a dramatic gourmet kick with the addition of rare, earthy morels. Moving further along this French direction, two great cuisines meet in the form of a Pan-Seared A9 Wagyu Beef Fillet with Mushroom Sauce. If it’s dimsum and traditional Cantonese roasts you’re after, lunch and brunch on the weekends is the best time to hit up this joint, with its popular buffet options. Either way, this is a meal that will stick around in your belly and mind with its commitment to fine ingredients, lovingly and innovatively prepared. (Jan 2018)

Now in celebration of its 8th anniversary, it seems fitting that Yantra has collaborated with world-renowned Chef Hemant Oberoi, who has cooked for the likes of world leaders and celebrities such as Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Margaret Thatcher, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie.
This is not your typical North India - the dishes are inspired by flavours from all over India, but with a contemporary twist. One stellar example, the Chicken Tikka Fondue, is the perfect marriage between chicken tikka marinated in spices and yogurt, and a tantalizing cheese fondue. From the Seafood Rassa to the Thepla Tacos, the dishes are also telling of Yantra’s unyielding conviction of using the freshest ingredients and spices hand-picked and flown in from India.
Yantra also turns fine dining up a notch with an interior that conveys an effortless sophistication and elegance, a clever reflection of its food. The extended bar which boasts of an imaginative range of specialty cocktails like the Tandoor Mojito and intriguing whiskies from Scotland’s finest whisky producing regions is also majorly impressive. Enough said, we’re sold on this unparalleled dining experience!

Step into the restaurant and the iconic yellow traffic light and flashing Walk/Don’t Walk sign greets you. It’s clear that the industrial chic, interior featuring custom-made lamps and bike handlebar stools, are a clear nod to New York’s urban landscape. Famed for its signature New York style pizzas that are large, wide, and thin Yellow Cab Pizza Co. remains to its brand with the use of premium ingredients and generous toppings. Even their pizza dough is prepared fresh daily!

The classic pizza here’s definitely New York’s Finest, featuring heapings of pork pepperoni, beef salami, ground beef, Italian sausage, ham, and fresh vegetables on a crispy medium-thick crust. For something a little more unique, the Dear Darla Roasted Garlic + Ricotta Cheese thin crust pizza can only be found at the Singapore outlet. The ricotta cheese creates rich textures while the roasted garlic elevates the taste profile with its fragrant flavour, making this a pizza you don’t want to miss! In the mood for some pasta? The Charlie Chan Chicken Pasta, featuring tender chicken strips, plump shiitake mushrooms, and roasted peanuts in a spicy oriental sauce, is another stellar option that’s uniquely Yellow Cab.

Roast duck is a popular mainstay of Chinese restaurants, and the one at Yellow Pot is first marinated for two days in a fermented beancurd paste, then roasted over hickory wood so the meat is aromatic and tender with a glistening layer of crispy skin. Vegetables are not an afterthought here, too. Try the sweet and sour eggplant, where the aubergine is braised and coated with a delicious housemade sauce of hot bean paste, honey, vinegar, and Nanyang soya sauce brewed by a local company.

There's a reason why Yum Cha always seems to be alive with hungry patrons, and that has a lot to do with their dim sum. Tried-and-true renditions of Xiao Long Bao, Prawn Dumplings, Fish Roe Siew Mai and more come piping hot from the kitchen, rolled in by traditional push cart to excited diners. The classics are certainly excellent, but Yum Cha also excels in trendier items like Malay Cake from Hong Kong, and Crispy Red Bean with Banana, which they challenge their kitchens to introduce to the menu every now and then. All are solid in taste with recipes very similar to those you grew up with, tossing you back into a haze of tasty nostalgia (or perhaps that's just a food coma).

This Bugis cafe and bistro delivers on the promise of “yum” in its name. Try the Chicken Shogayaki Bowl, tender chunks of chicken thigh, a comforting garlic ginger sauce, shredded seaweed, and pickled ginger top a bowlful of chewy long grains, making for warm, chickeny mouthfuls. Then there’s the Smoked Salmon Bowl, think a massive sushi roll in a bowl: vinegared rice is topped with fatty smoked Norwegian salmon and creamy avocado, then garnished with tobiko, and a zingy sprinkling of lemon zest. For a carb bomb of a different sort, try the Beef Burger, fluffy brioche buns filled with a rich grilled patty, fat mushroom, all enrobed by some melty Emmental cheese. Pair all that with some Shitake Tempura, tender shiitake mushrooms battered till crispy and served with mayo and a squeeze of lemon. Wash it all down with a helping of the house Espresso, and some Tempura Ice Cream, a magical battered block of creamy heaven served with salted caramel sauce. Comfort food at its best! (Jun 2017)

Inspired by the prized value of saffron and its flower containing 3 stigmas, called
threads, Zafferano focuses on value, and the 3 ‘threads’ of Food, Service, and
Ambience. As the only Italian restaurant to feature a 43rd-storey perch and amazing
rooftop bar overlooking the spectacular Marina Water Front, Zafferano embodies the
Italian spirit of giving. Head Chef Andrea De Paolo presents a contemporary
interpretation of traditional Italian cuisine; and a celebration of prime produce. On the
dining floor, the front-of-house team orchestrates their own brand of elegant Italian
service – seamlessly threading together a paragon of warmth, Italian-style, for any
occasion, big or small, in the heart of the business district.

From classic Hindustani tandoori to flaky Malay roti, Zaffron speaks the universal language of savoury Indian cuisine fluently.Zaffron Kitchen in Katong takes on the look preferred by many fresh-faced gastropubs and open dining concepts lately, but it's a novel makeunder for an Indian restaurant. A smattering of various seating arrangements from communal high tops to rustic wood bistro tables makes the space feel social. The dining area is grounded by floors made of modern concrete and vintage Perankan tiles, peppered with the common hue of deep saffron orange, and lit up by non-traditional fixtures. There's a children's area that encourages play, and the vibe in general is fluid and open.
The menu takes a similarly light and easygoing approach to Indian fare. A genre of cooking typically known for rich, hearty and spicy flavours, Indian cuisine is smartly organized into weekend only specialties of South Indian Dosai and Roti Prata, anytime snacks like crispy Bhel Puri and Samosa, and perennial North Indian classics of clay oven roasted Tandoori dishes and curries. The categories make the encyclopedic cuisine feel more accessible to those naan novices who are less familiar with Indian fare.
However those curry connoisseurs will be equally impressed with the complex, spot-on flavours of the offerings. The Fish Tikka here is especially scrumptious, made with salmon for a more unique texture that stands up to the marinade brilliantly. The Tandoori Malay Chicken Tikka, though it carries a similar name, has a distinctly different interplay between the medley of spices and the tender morsels of chicken. On the weekends, the Keema Dosai is a unique treat that must be tried. For the uninitiated, the familiar paper-thin, sourdough crepe is crisped fresh to order and filled with spiced minced ground meat. It's a killer, homestyle combination that you don't often see, which is a common theme at Zaffron Kitchen. Indian cuisine done so consistently well with modern approachability is certainly a rare sight - and taste - indeed.

Tasty favorites such as Butter Chicken, Tandoori Chicken, and Naan are signature dishes that attract hordes of diners to the restaurant. From the choice of starters, the Papadum is highly recommended. This traditional dish is served with assorted homemade chutneys for you to dip the crispy wafer-thin crackers in. Pair it with a bowl of Pakora for extra crunch.
Freshly baked in the restaurant’s tandoor ovens, choose from a delightful spread of bread such as Naan and Roti. Stuffed with melted cheese, the Cheese Naan delights diners with mouthfuls of cheesy goodness. For meat lovers, the Chicken Tikka is a must-try! Marinated with spices and yogurt, skewers of succulent chicken are baked to juicy goodness. An equally extensive selection awaits vegetarians. From Paneer Tikka to Tandori Mushroom, vegetarians will be spoilt for choice.
